Configuration File Reference for USB_ModeSwitch
-----------------------------------------------

Last modified: 2015-06-27



General Rules:

Numbers can be decimal or hexadecimal, Bulk message strings must be
hexadecimal without prepended "0x". Digits 9-16 (message tag) in
mass storage messages (which start with "55534243") are random; I set
them to "12345678". Not that you must make them unique if more than
one MessageContent is used.

-> ALL MISTYPED PARAMETERS AND OTHER ENTRIES ARE SILENTLY IGNORED <-



Parameter Reference:

Note: if there is a short command line flag for a parameter, then it
is appended to the line. For the full command line parameter reference
see the usb_modeswitch(1) man page.


* DefaultVendor            -v <hex number>
* DefaultProduct           -p <hex number>

This is the ID the USB device shows after having been plugged in.
The program needs this, either on the command line or in the config
file; if not found -> no action.

Note: newer config files do not contain these parameters because of
the redundancy with regard to the config file name.


* TargetVendor             -V <hex number>
* TargetProduct            -P <hex number>

These are the IDs of the USB device after successful mode switching.
They are optional, but required for a proper success check


* TargetProductList        <comma separated hex strings without "0x">

Like TargetProduct, but multiple targets


* TargetClass              -C <hex number>

Some devices don't change their ID, only their layout. To check for a 
successfull mode switch, the class of the first interface is checked


* MessageEndpoint          -m <hex number>
* ResponseEndpoint         -r <hex number>

A kind of address inside the interface to which the "message"
(the sequence that does the actual switching) is directed or
from which the reply is read if NeedResponse is active.
OBSOLETE since version 0.9.7 due to autodetection, only useful for
testing


* MessageContent           -M <hex string>

A hex string containing the "message" sequence; it will be
sent as a USB bulk transfer


* MessageContent2, ...3    -2/-3 <hex string>

Additional "messages". Use with "NeedResponse"!


* ReleaseDelay             -w <milliseconds>

Waiting time after message transfers. Helps with some sensitive devices
that don't want any traffic after the mode switch initialisation


* NeedResponse <0/1>       -n

Some devices were reported to require receiving the response of the
bulk transfer to do the switching properly. Usually not needed.


* DetachStorageOnly <0/1>  -d

Some early devices just needed to be detached from the usb-storage
driver to initiate the mode switching. Now practically obsolete for
switching, but still comes handy sometimes


* StandardEject <0/1>      -K

Sends a specific bulk message sequence representing the SCSI commands
"ALLOW MEDIUM REMOVAL" and "START STOP UNIT", basically an eject
action. Many modems are using this for mode switching


* HuaweiMode <0/1>         -H

Some early Huawei devices can be switched by a special control
message. Don't use with recent devices


* HuaweiNewMode <0/1>      -J

The standard for all newer Huawei devices. Sends a specific bulk message,
but different target layouts may be reached with variants of that
message; use MessageContent for these


* SonyMode <0/1>           -O

Some Sony-Ericsson devices can be switched by a special control
message. May take a long time (20+ seconds).


* SierraMode <0/1>         -S
* KobilMode <0/1>          -T
* GCTMode <0/1>            -G
* SequansMode <0/1>        -N
* MobileActionMode <0/1>   -A
* QisdaMode <0/1>          -B
* QuantaMode <0/1>         -E
* BlackberryMode <0/1>     -Z
* CiscoMode <0/1>          -L


Flags to support devices that need special control messages.
The names are referring to the respective manufacturers.


* PantechMode              -F <num value>

Extended flag for Pantech devices offering multiple target modes. Not
all models were confirmed to support all modes. Possible values are:

    1 - Automatic choice, checks for MBIM driver availability (recomm.)
    2 - forced RNDIS mode
    3 - forced CDC Ether mode (internal switch, no usb_modeswitch action)
    4 - forced MBIM mode

Important: the -F parameter value for usb_modeswitch is directly used as
wValue in the control message!


* ResetUSB <0/1>           -R

Few devices or systems need a rougher treatment. If the switching seems
to do something but your system does not reflect it, try this somewhat
brutal method to do a reset after switching. May also be useful for
all kinds of experiments


* Configuration            -u <hex number>

Some devices are doing the "right" thing and provide different layouts
in the standard-compliant way. They don't "restart", so don't have to be
rediscovered by the system after the change. Strictly speaking, they are
not doing a mode switch


* Interface                -i <hex number>
* AltSetting               -a <hex number>

More USB parameter to help with tricky devices and for doing lots
of cruel experiments; usually not needed ...


Note:
AltSetting/Configuration changes and ResetUSB are executed after all
other steps and can be combined or used on their own (e.g. a reset
might have the same effect as a manual replug)


* InquireDevice <0|1>      -I (enables inquiry)

Prints out SCSI device attributes in addition to USB device attributes.
These may be used later to tell apart ambiguous device IDs. Only needed
for creating new configurations


* CheckSuccess             -s <number>

Check continuously if the switch succeeded for max <number> seconds.
If the target ID is given, the check waits for it to appear.
Otherwise, the check waits for the device to "go away"; most devices
vanish after switching and can't be accessed anymore. It also checks
the bus/device count, trying to determine if the device "came back"

Note: this feature is not used in the full-featured Linux package of
usb_modeswitch where the success check is done by the wrapper script


* NoDriverLoading <0|1>    (no command line parameter)

The binary tells the wrapper script NOT to check for and initiate
binding of the serial driver after switching.
Mostly useful for non-modem devices and newer modems which do not use
the serial driver.


* WaitBefore <seconds>     (no command line parameter)

Waiting time before taking any action. Helps with some sensitive setups.


* NoMBIMCheck <0|1>        (no command line parameter)

Disable the check for devices providing the MBIM standard; this check
is otherwise done by default. See /etc/usb_modeswitch.conf from the
program package for a global setting regarding this.
