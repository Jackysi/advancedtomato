+is known as a "VPATH" build.
 
    With a non-GNU `make', it is safer to compile the package for one
 architecture at a time in the source code directory.  After you have
 installed the package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before
 reconfiguring for another architecture.
 
+   On MacOS X 10.5 and later systems, you can create libraries and
+executables that work on multiple system types--known as "fat" or
+"universal" binaries--by specifying multiple `-arch' options to the
+compiler but only a single `-arch' option to the preprocessor.  Like
+this:

+you can set and what kinds of files go in them.  In general, the
+default for these options is expressed in terms of `${prefix}', so that
+specifying just `--prefix' will affect all of the other directory
+specifications that were not explicitly provided.
+
+   The most portable way to affect installation locations is to pass the
+correct locations to `configure'; however, many packages provide one or
+both of the following shortcuts of passing variable assignments to the
+`make install' command line to change installation locations without
+having to reconfigure or recompile.
+
+   The first method involves providing an override variable for each
+affected directory.  For example, `make install
+prefix=/alternate/directory' will choose an alternate location for all
+directory configuration variables that were expressed in terms of
+`${prefix}'.  Any directories that were specified during `configure',
+but not in terms of `${prefix}', must each be overridden at install
+time for the entire installation to be relocated.  The approach of
+makefile variable overrides for each directory variable is required by
+the GNU Coding Standards, and ideally causes no recompilation.
+However, some platforms have known limitations with the semantics of
+shared libraries that end up requiring recompilation when using this
+method, particularly noticeable in packages that use GNU Libtool.
+
+   The second method involves providing the `DESTDIR' variable.  For
+example, `make install DESTDIR=/alternate/directory' will prepend
+`/alternate/directory' before all installation names.  The approach of
+`DESTDIR' overrides is not required by the GNU Coding Standards, and
+does not work on platforms that have drive letters.  On the other hand,
+it does better at avoiding recompilation issues, and works well even
+when some directory options were not specified in terms of `${prefix}'
+at `configure' time.
+
+Optional Features
+=================
 
    If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
 with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
 option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

+   Some packages offer the ability to configure how verbose the
+execution of `make' will be.  For these packages, running `./configure
+--enable-silent-rules' sets the default to minimal output, which can be
+overridden with `make V=1'; while running `./configure
+--disable-silent-rules' sets the default to verbose, which can be
+overridden with `make V=0'.
+
+Particular systems
+==================
+
+   On HP-UX, the default C compiler is not ANSI C compatible.  If GNU
+CC is not installed, it is recommended to use the following options in
+order to use an ANSI C compiler:
+
+     ./configure CC="cc -Ae -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500"
+
+and if that doesn't work, install pre-built binaries of GCC for HP-UX.
+
+   HP-UX `make' updates targets which have the same time stamps as
+their prerequisites, which makes it generally unusable when shipped
+generated files such as `configure' are involved.  Use GNU `make'
+instead.
+
+   On OSF/1 a.k.a. Tru64, some versions of the default C compiler cannot
+parse its `<wchar.h>' header file.  The option `-nodtk' can be used as
+a workaround.  If GNU CC is not installed, it is therefore recommended
+to try
+
+     ./configure CC="cc"
+
+and if that doesn't work, try
+
+     ./configure CC="cc -nodtk"
+
+   On Solaris, don't put `/usr/ucb' early in your `PATH'.  This
+directory contains several dysfunctional programs; working variants of
+these programs are available in `/usr/bin'.  So, if you need `/usr/ucb'
+in your `PATH', put it _after_ `/usr/bin'.
+
+   On Haiku, software installed for all users goes in `/boot/common',
+not `/usr/local'.  It is recommended to use the following options:
+
+     ./configure --prefix=/boot/common

-  -module           build a library that can dlopened
-  -no-fast-install  disable the fast-install mode
-  -no-install       link a not-installable executable
-  -no-undefined     declare that a library does not refer to external symbols

+\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no\-action\fR
+Test the consistency of a saved image by simulating its restoring without
+writing anything. The NTFS data contained in the image is not tested.
+The option \fB\-\-restore\-image\fR must also be present, and the options
+\fB\-\-output\fR and \fB\-\-overwrite\fR must be omitted.
+.TP

 Ignore disk read errors so disks having bad sectors, e.g. dying disks, can be
 rescued the most efficiently way, with minimal stress on them. Ntfsclone works

+.SH NAME
+ntfsdecrypt \- decrypt or update NTFS files encrypted according to EFS
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+\fBntfsdecrypt\fR [\fIoptions\fR] -k \fIkey.pfx \fIdevice file\fR
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.B ntfsdecrypt
+decrypts a file from an unmounted device and print the decrypted data
+on the standard output.
+It can also update an encrypted file with the encryption key unchanged.
+.PP
+The NTFS file encryption (known as EFS) uses a two-level encryption :
+first, the file contents is encrypted with a random symmetric key, then
+this symmetric key is encrypted with the public keys of each of the users
+allowed to decrypt the file (RSA public key encryptions).
+.P
+Three symmetric encryption modes are currently implemented in ntfsdecrypt :
+DESX (a DES variant), 3DES (triple DES) and AES_256 (an AES variant).
+.P
+All the encrypted symmetric keys are stored along with the file in a
+special extended attribute named "$LOGGED_UTILITY_STREAM".
+Usually, at least two users are allowed to read the file : its owner and
+the recovery manager who is able to decrypt all the files in a company.
+When backing up an encrypted file, it is important to also backup the
+corresponding $LOGGED_UTILITY_STREAM, otherwise the file cannot be
+decrypted, even by the recovery manager. Also note that encrypted files
+are slightly bigger than apparent, and the option "efs_raw" has
+to be used when backing up encrypted files with ntfs-3g.
+.P
+When ntfsdecrypt is used to update a file, the keys and the
+$LOGGED_UTILITY_STREAM are kept unchanged, so a single key file has to
+be designated.
+.P
+Note : the EFS encryption is only available in professional versions
+of Windows;
+.SH OPTIONS
+Below is a summary of all the options that
+.B ntfsdecrypt
+accepts.  Nearly all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is
+preceded by
+.B \-
+and the long name is preceded by
+.BR \-\- .
+Any single letter options, that don't take an argument, can be combined into a
+single command, e.g.
+.B \-fv
+is equivalent to
+.BR "\-f \-v" .
+Long named options can be abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.
+.TP
+\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-inode\fR NUM
+Display or update the contents of a file designated through its inode number
+instead of its name.
+.TP
+\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-encrypt\fR
+Update an existing encrypted file and get the new contents from the
+standard input. The full public and private key file has to be designated,
+as the symmetric key is kept unchanged, so the private key is needed to
+extract it.
+.TP
+\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
+This will override some sensible defaults, such as not using a mounted volume.
+Use this option with caution.
+.TP
+\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-keyfile\-name\fR key.pfx
+Define the file which contains the public and private keys in PKCS#12 format.
+This file obviously contains the keys of one of the users allowed to decrypt
+or update the file. It has to be extracted from Windows in PKCS#12 format
+(its usual suffix is .p12 or .pfx), and it is protected by a passphrase
+which has to be typed in for the keys to be extracted. This can be the
+key file of any user allowed to read the file, including the one of the
+recovery manager.
+.TP
+\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
+Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.
+.TP
+\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
+Suppress some debug/warning/error messages.
+.TP
+\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
+Show the version number, copyright and license of
+.BR ntfsdecrypt .
+.TP
+\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
+Display more debug/warning/error messages.
+.SH EXAMPLES

+.TH NTFSFALLOCATE 8 "June 2014" "ntfs-3g @VERSION@"
+.SH NAME
+ntfsfallocate \- preallocate space to a file on an NTFS volume
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+\fBntfsfallocate\fR [\fIoptions\fR] -l \fIlength\fR \fIdevice\fR \fIfile\fR \fI[attr-type\fR [\fIattr-name\fR]]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.B ntfsfallocate
+preallocates space for any attribute of a file or directory, thus reserving
+space before actual contents is written. This is similar to fallocate(1).
+.SH OPTIONS
+Below is a summary of all the options that
+.B ntfsfallocate
+accepts.  Nearly all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is
+preceded by
+.B \-
+and the long name is preceded by
+.BR \-\- .
+Any single letter options, that don't take an argument, can be combined into a
+single command, e.g.
+.B \-fv
+is equivalent to
+.BR "\-f \-v" .
+Long named options can be abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.
+.TP
+\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
+This will override some sensible defaults, such as not using a mounted volume.
+Use this option with caution.
+.TP
+\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
+Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.
+.TP
+\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-length\fR LENGTH
+This is a mandatory option to specify the number of bytes to preallocate.
+It will be rounded up to a multiple of the cluster size.
+A suffix of K, M, G, T, P or E may be appended to
+mean a multiplicative factor of a power of 1000. Similarly a suffix of
+Ki, Mi, Gi, Ti, Pi or Ei may be appended to mean a multiplicative factor
+of a power of 1024.
+.TP
+\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no-size-change\fR
+Do not change the apparent size of the file. The space allocated beyond
+the apparent size is not zeroed, but subsequent writing beyond the apparent
+end of file will force zeroing the inner allocated space as it cannot be
+considered as a hole any more, and this may take significant time.
+.TP
+\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-no-action\fR
+Simulate the allocation without actually write to device.
+.TP
+\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-offset\fR OFFSET
+Specify the offset in the file where preallocation starts. By default,
+the preallocation is counted from the beginning of the file. Space already
+allocated in the area defined by offset and length is preserved.
+.TP
+\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
+Suppress some debug/warning/error messages.
+.TP
+\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
+Display more debug/warning/error messages.
+.TP
+\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
+Show the version number, copyright and license of
+.BR ntfsfallocate .
+.TP
+\fBattr-type\fR
+Define a particular attribute type to be preallocated (advanced use only).
+By default, the unnamed $DATA attribute (the contents of a plain file) will
+be preallocated. The attribute has to be specified by a number in decimal
+or hexadecimal :
+.TS
+box;
+lB lB lB
+l l l.
+Hex	Decimal	Name
+0x10	16	"$STANDARD_INFORMATION"
+0x20	32	"$ATTRIBUTE_LIST"

+0xE0	224	"$EA"
+0xF0	240	"$PROPERTY_SET"
+0x100	256	"$LOGGED_UTILITY_STREAM"
+.TE
+.sp
+.TP
+\fBattr-name\fR
+Define the name of the particular attribute type to be preallocated
+(advanced use only).
+.SH EXAMPLES
+Preallocate 100MB to the file database.db located in the Data directory
+which is at the root of an NTFS file system.
+.RS
+.sp
+.B ntfsfallocate -l 100M /dev/sda1 Data/database.db
+.sp
+.RE
+.SH BUGS
+There are no known problems with
+.BR ntfsfallocate ,
+however it can lead to configurations not supported by Windows
+and Windows may crash (BSOD) when writing to preallocated clusters
+which were not written to earlier. Files with preallocated space should
+be fully be written to before they are updated by Windows.

+.TH NTFSTRUNCATE 8 "June 2014" "ntfs-3g @VERSION@"
+.SH NAME
+ntfstruncate \- truncate a file on an NTFS volume
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+\fBntfstruncate\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIdevice\fR \fIfile\fR \fI[attr-type\fR [\fIattr-name\fR]] \fInew-length\fR
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.B ntfstruncate
+truncates (or extends) a specified attribute belonging to a
+file or directory, to a specified length.
+.SH OPTIONS
+Below is a summary of all the options that
+.B ntfstruncate
+accepts.  Nearly all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is
+preceded by
+.B \-
+and the long name is preceded by
+.BR \-\- .
+Any single letter options, that don't take an argument, can be combined into a
+single command, e.g.
+.B \-fv
+is equivalent to
+.BR "\-f \-v" .
+Long named options can be abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.
+.TP
+\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
+This will override some sensible defaults, such as not using a mounted volume.
+Use this option with caution.
+.TP
+\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
+Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.
+.TP
+\fB\-l\fR
+Display licensing information.
+.TP
+\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no-action\fR
+Simulate the truncation without actually write to device.
+.TP
+\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
+Suppress some debug/warning/error messages.
+.TP
+\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
+Display more debug/warning/error messages.
+.TP
+\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
+Show the version number, copyright and license of
+.BR ntfstruncate .
+.TP
+\fBattr-type\fR
+Define a particular attribute type to be truncated (advanced use only).
+By default, the unnamed $DATA attribute (the contents of a plain file) will
+be truncated. The attribute has to be specified by a number in decimal
+or hexadecimal :
+.TS
+box;
+lB lB lB
+l l l.

+0xF0	240	"$PROPERTY_SET"
+0x100	256	"$LOGGED_UTILITY_STREAM"
+.TE
+.sp
+.TP
+\fBattr-name\fR
+Define the name of the particular attribute type to be truncated
+(advanced use only).
+.sp
+.TP
+\fBnew-length\fR
+Specify the target size of the file.
+It will be rounded up to a multiple of the cluster size.
+A suffix of K, M, G, T, P or E may be appended to
+mean a multiplicative factor of a power of 1000. Similarly a suffix of
+Ki, Mi, Gi, Ti, Pi or Ei may be appended to mean a multiplicative factor
+of a power of 1024.
+.SH EXAMPLES
+Resize to 100MB the file database.db located in the Data directory
+which is at the root of an NTFS file system.

+.SH NAME
+ntfswipe \- overwrite unused space on an NTFS volume
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+\fBntfswipe\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIdevice\fR
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.B ntfswipe
+clears all or part of unused space on an NTFS volume by overwriting
+with zeroes or random bytes.
+.SH OPTIONS
+Below is a summary of all the options that
+.B ntfswipe
+accepts.  Nearly all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is
+preceded by
+.B \-
+and the long name is preceded by
+.BR \-\- .
+Any single letter options, that don't take an argument, can be combined into a
+single command, e.g.
+.B \-fv
+is equivalent to
+.BR "\-f \-v" .
+Long named options can be abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.
+.TP
+\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR
+Wipe all unused space. This may take significant time.
+.TP
+\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-bytes\fR BYTE-LIST
+Define the allowed replacement bytes which are drawn randomly to overwrite
+the unused space. BYTE-LIST is a comma-separated list of values in
+range 0-255 expressed in octal, decimal or hexadecimal base.
+.TP
+\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-count\fR NUM
+Define the number of times the unused space is to be overwritten.
+.TP
+\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-directory\fR
+Wipe all the directory indexes, which may contain names of deleted files.
+.TP
+\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
+This will override some sensible defaults, such as not using a mounted volume.
+Use this option with caution.
+.TP
+\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
+Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.
+.TP
+\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-info\fR
+Display details about unused space.
+.TP
+\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-logfile\fR
+Overwrite the logfile (update journal).
+.TP
+\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-mft\fR
+Overwrite the unused space in the MFT (main file table, which contains the
+file names, and the contents of short files).
+.TP
+\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no-action\fR
+Executes the wiping process without writing to device.
+.TP
+\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-pagefile\fR
+Overwrite the Windows swap space.
+.TP
+\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
+Suppress some debug/warning/error messages.
+.TP
+\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-undel\fR
+Overwrite the space which had been allocated to a file which has been deleted
+recently and is still undeletable.
+.TP
+\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-tails\fR
+Overwrite the space at the end of files which is unused, but allocated
+because the allocations are always done by full clusters.
+.TP
+\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-unused\fR
+Overwrite the space which is currently not allocated to any file (but
+may have been used in the past).
+.TP
+\fB\-U\fR, \fB\-\-unused-fast\fR
+Overwrite the space which is currently not allocated to any file, trying
+not to overwrite the space not written to since the previous wiping.
+.TP
+\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
+Display more debug/warning/error messages.
+.TP
+\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
+Show the version number, copyright and license of
+.BR ntfswipe .
