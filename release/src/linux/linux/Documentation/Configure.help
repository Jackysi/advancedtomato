Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers
CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL
  Some of the various things that Linux supports (such as network
  drivers, file systems, network protocols, etc.) can be in a state
  of development where the functionality, stability, or the level of
  testing is not yet high enough for general use. This is usually
  known as the "alpha-test" phase among developers. If a feature is
  currently in alpha-test, then the developers usually discourage
  uninformed widespread use of this feature by the general public to
  avoid "Why doesn't this work?" type mail messages. However, active
  testing and use of these systems is welcomed. Just be aware that it
  may not meet the normal level of reliability or it may fail to work
  in some special cases. Detailed bug reports from people familiar
  with the kernel internals are usually welcomed by the developers
  (before submitting bug reports, please read the documents
  <file:README>, <file:MAINTAINERS>, <file:REPORTING-BUGS>,
  <file:Documentation/BUG-HUNTING>, and
  <file:Documentation/oops-tracing.txt> in the kernel source).

  This option will also make obsoleted drivers available. These are
  drivers that have been replaced by something else, and/or are
  scheduled to be removed in a future kernel release.

  Unless you intend to help test and develop a feature or driver that
  falls into this category, or you have a situation that requires
  using these features, you should probably say N here, which will
  cause the configurator to present you with fewer choices. If
  you say Y here, you will be offered the choice of using features or
  drivers that are currently considered to be in the alpha-test phase.

Prompt for drivers for obsolete features and hardware
CONFIG_OBSOLETE
  Obsolete drivers have usually been replaced by more recent software
  that can talk to the same hardware.  Obsolete hardware is things
  like MGA monitors that you are very unlikely to see on today's
  systems.

Symmetric Multi-Processing support
CONFIG_SMP
  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
  a system with only one CPU, like most personal computers, say N. If
  you have a system with more than one CPU, say Y.

  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
  single machines. On a singleprocessor machine, the kernel
  will run faster if you say N here.

  Note that if you say Y here and choose architecture "586" or
  "Pentium" under "Processor family", the kernel will not work on 486
  architectures. Similarly, multiprocessor kernels for the "PPro"
  architecture may not work on all Pentium based boards.

  People using multiprocessor machines who say Y here should also say
  Y to "Enhanced Real Time Clock Support", below. The "Advanced Power
  Management" code will be disabled if you say Y here.

  See also the <file:Documentation/smp.tex>,
  <file:Documentation/smp.txt>, <file:Documentation/i386/IO-APIC.txt>,
  <file:Documentation/nmi_watchdog.txt> and the SMP-HOWTO available at
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  If you don't know what to do here, say N.

Intel or compatible 80x86 processor
CONFIG_X86
  This is Linux's home port.  Linux was originally native to the Intel
  386, and runs on all the later x86 processors including the Intel
  486, 586, Pentiums, and various instruction-set-compatible chips by
  AMD, Cyrix, and others.

Alpha processor
CONFIG_ALPHA
  The Alpha is a 64-bit general-purpose processor designed and
  marketed by the Digital Equipment Corporation of blessed memory, now
  Compaq.  Alpha Linux dates from 1995-1996 and was the first non-x86
  port. The Alpha Linux project has a home page at
  <http://www.alphalinux.org/>.

32-bit Sun Sparc
CONFIG_SPARC32
  SPARC is a family of RISC microprocessors designed and marketed by
  Sun Microsystems, incorporated.  They are very widely found in Sun
  workstations and clones. This port covers the original 32-bit SPARC;
  it is old and stable and usually considered one of the "big three"
  along with the Intel and Alpha ports.  The UltraLinux project
  maintains both the SPARC32 and SPARC64 ports; its web page is
  available at <http://www.ultralinux.org/>.

64-bit Sun Sparc
CONFIG_SPARC64
  SPARC is a family of RISC microprocessors designed and marketed by
  Sun Microsystems, incorporated.  This port covers the newer 64-bit
  UltraSPARC.  The UltraLinux project maintains both the SPARC32 and
  SPARC64 ports; its web page is available at
  <http://www.ultralinux.org/>.

Power PC processor
CONFIG_PPC
  The PowerPC is a very capable 32-bit RISC processor from Motorola,
  the successor to their 68000 and 88000 series.  It powers recent
  Macintoshes and also a widely-used series of single-board computers
  from Motorola.  The Linux PowerPC port has a home page at
  <http://penguinppc.org/>.

Motorola 68K processors
CONFIG_M68K
  The Motorola 68K microprocessors are now obsolete, having been
  superseded by the PowerPC line also from Motorola.  But they powered
  the first wave of workstation hardware in the 1980s, including Sun
  workstations; they were also the basis of the original Amiga and
  later Atari personal computers.  A lot of this hardware is still
  around.  The m68k project has a home page at
  <http://www.linux-m68k.org/>.

ARM processors
CONFIG_ARM
  The ARM series is a line of low-power-consumption RISC chip designs
  licensed by ARM ltd and targeted at embedded applications and
  handhelds such as the Compaq IPAQ.  ARM-based PCs are no longer
  manufactured, but  legacy ARM-based PC hardware remains popular in
  Europe.  There is an ARM Linux project with a web page at
  <http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/>.

SuperH processors
CONFIG_SUPERH
  The SuperH is a RISC processor targeted for use in embedded systems
  and consumer electronics; it was also used in the Sega Dreamcast
  gaming console.  The SuperH port has a home page at
  <http://www.sh-linux.org/>.

IA64 processors, including Intel Itanium
CONFIG_IA64
  The Itanium is Intel's 64-bit successor to the 32-bit X86 line.  As
  of early 2001 it is not yet in widespread production use.  The Linux
  IA-64 project has a home page at <http://www.linuxia64.org/>.

HP PA-RISC processor
CONFIG_PARISC
  The PA-RISC microprocessor is a RISC chip designed by
  Hewlett-Packard and used in their line of workstations.  The PA-RISC
  Linux project has a home page at <www.parisc-linux.org>.

IBM System/390
CONFIG_S390
  Linux now runs on the venerable System/390 mainframe from IBM, in a
  guest partition under VM.  In fact, over 40,000 simultaneous Linux
  images have been run on a single mainframe!  The S390 Linux project
  has a home page at <http://linux.s390.org/>.

Axis Communications ETRAX 100LX embedded network CPU
CONFIG_CRIS
  Linux has been ported to run on the Axis Communications ETRAX 100LX
  CPU and the single-board computers built around it, targeted for
  network and embedded applications.  For more information see the
  Axis Communication site, <http://developer.axis.com/>.

Unsynced TSC support
CONFIG_X86_TSC_DISABLE
  This option is used for getting Linux to run on a NUMA multi-node 
  boxes, laptops and other systems suffering from unsynced TSCs or 
  TSC drift, which can cause gettimeofday to return non-monotonic values. 
  Choosing this option will disable the CONFIG_X86_TSC optimization,
  and allows you to then specify "notsc" as a boot option regardless of 
  which processor you have compiled for. 
  
  NOTE: If your system hangs when init should run, you are probably
  using a i686 compiled glibc which reads the TSC without checking for 
  availability. Boot without "notsc" and install a i386 compiled glibc 
  to solve the problem.

  If unsure, say N.

Multiquad support for NUMA systems
CONFIG_MULTIQUAD
  This option is used for getting Linux to run on a (IBM/Sequent) NUMA 
  multiquad box. This changes the way that processors are bootstrapped,
  and uses Clustered Logical APIC addressing mode instead of Flat Logical.
  You will need a new lynxer.elf file to flash your firmware with - send
  email to Martin.Bligh@us.ibm.com

IO-APIC support on uniprocessors
CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC
  An IO-APIC (I/O Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) is an
  SMP-capable replacement for PC-style interrupt controllers. Most
  SMP systems and a small number of uniprocessor systems have one.
  If you have a single-CPU system with an IO-APIC, you can say Y here
  to use it. If you say Y here even though your machine doesn't have
  an IO-APIC, then the kernel will still run with no slowdown at all.

  If you have a system with several CPUs, you do not need to say Y
  here: the IO-APIC will be used automatically.

Local APIC Support on Uniprocessors
CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC
  A local APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) is an
  integrated interrupt controller in the CPU. If you have a single-CPU
  system which has a processor with a local APIC, you can say Y here to
  enable and use it. If you say Y here even though your machine doesn't
  have a local APIC, then the kernel will still run with no slowdown at
  all. The local APIC supports CPU-generated self-interrupts (timer,
  performance counters), and the NMI watchdog which detects hard lockups.

  If you have a system with several CPUs, you do not need to say Y
  here: the local APIC will be used automatically.

Kernel math emulation
CONFIG_MATH_EMULATION
  Linux can emulate a math coprocessor (used for floating point
  operations) if you don't have one. 486DX and Pentium processors have
  a math coprocessor built in, 486SX and 386 do not, unless you added
  a 487DX or 387, respectively. (The messages during boot time can
  give you some hints here ["man dmesg"].) Everyone needs either a
  coprocessor or this emulation.

  If you don't have a math coprocessor, you need to say Y here; if you
  say Y here even though you have a coprocessor, the coprocessor will
  be used nevertheless. (This behaviour can be changed with the kernel
  command line option "no387", which comes handy if your coprocessor
  is broken. Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of your boot
  loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel at
  boot time.) This means that it is a good idea to say Y here if you
  intend to use this kernel on different machines.

  More information about the internals of the Linux math coprocessor
  emulation can be found in <file:arch/i386/math-emu/README>.

  If you are not sure, say Y; apart from resulting in a 66 KB bigger
  kernel, it won't hurt.

Timer and CPU usage LEDs
CONFIG_LEDS
  If you say Y here, the LEDs on your machine will be used
  to provide useful information about your current system status.

  If you are compiling a kernel for a NetWinder or EBSA-285, you will
  be able to select which LEDs are active using the options below. If
  you are compiling a kernel for the EBSA-110 or the LART however, the
  red LED will simply flash regularly to indicate that the system is
  still functional. It is safe to say Y here if you have a CATS
  system, but the driver will do nothing.

Timer LED
CONFIG_LEDS_TIMER
  If you say Y here, one of the system LEDs (the green one on the
  NetWinder, the amber one on the EBSA285, or the red one on the LART)
  will flash regularly to indicate that the system is still
  operational. This is mainly useful to kernel hackers who are
  debugging unstable kernels.

  The LART uses the same LED for both Timer LED and CPU usage LED
  functions. You may choose to use both, but the Timer LED function
  will overrule the CPU usage LED.

CPU usage LED
CONFIG_LEDS_CPU
  If you say Y here, the red LED will be used to give a good real
  time indication of CPU usage, by lighting whenever the idle task
  is not currently executing.

  The LART uses the same LED for both Timer LED and CPU usage LED
  functions. You may choose to use both, but the Timer LED function
  will overrule the CPU usage LED.

Kernel FP software completion
CONFIG_MATHEMU
  This option is required for IEEE compliant floating point arithmetic
  on the Alpha. The only time you would ever not say Y is to say M in
  order to debug the code. Say Y unless you know what you are doing.

# Choice: himem
High Memory support
CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM
  Linux can use up to 64 Gigabytes of physical memory on x86 systems.
  However, the address space of 32-bit x86 processors is only 4
  Gigabytes large. That means that, if you have a large amount of
  physical memory, not all of it can be "permanently mapped" by the
  kernel. The physical memory that's not permanently mapped is called
  "high memory".

  If you are compiling a kernel which will never run on a machine with
  more than 960 megabytes of total physical RAM, answer "off" here (default
  choice and suitable for most users). This will result in a "3GB/1GB"
  split: 3GB are mapped so that each process sees a 3GB virtual memory
  space and the remaining part of the 4GB virtual memory space is used
  by the kernel to permanently map as much physical memory as
  possible.

  If the machine has between 1 and 4 Gigabytes physical RAM, then
  answer "4GB" here.

  If more than 4 Gigabytes is used then answer "64GB" here. This
  selection turns Intel PAE (Physical Address Extension) mode on.
  PAE implements 3-level paging on IA32 processors. PAE is fully
  supported by Linux, PAE mode is implemented on all recent Intel
  processors (Pentium Pro and better). NOTE: If you say "64GB" here,
  then the kernel will not boot on CPUs that don't support PAE!

  The actual amount of total physical memory will either be auto
  detected or can be forced by using a kernel command line option such
  as "mem=256M". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of your
  boot loader (grub, lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the
  kernel at boot time.)

  If unsure, say "off".

4GB
CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G
  Select this if you have a 32-bit processor and between 1 and 4
  gigabytes of physical RAM.

64GB
CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G
  Select this if you have a 32-bit processor and more than 4
  gigabytes of physical RAM.

HIGHMEM I/O support
CONFIG_HIGHIO
  If you want to be able to do I/O to high memory pages, say Y.
  Otherwise low memory pages are used as bounce buffers causing a
  degrade in performance.

Normal floppy disk support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_FD
  If you want to use the floppy disk drive(s) of your PC under Linux,
  say Y. Information about this driver, especially important for IBM
  Thinkpad users, is contained in <file:Documentation/floppy.txt>.
  That file also contains the location of the Floppy driver FAQ as
  well as location of the fdutils package used to configure additional
  parameters of the driver at run time.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called floppy.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

iSeries Virtual I/O Disk Support
CONFIG_VIODASD
  If you are running on an iSeries system and you want to use
  virtual disks created and managed by OS/400, say Y.

iSeries Virtual I/O Disk IDE Emulation
CONFIG_VIODASD_IDE
  This causes the iSeries virtual disks to look like IDE disks.
  If you have programs or utilities that only support certain
  kinds of disks, this option will cause iSeries virtual disks
  to pretend to be IDE disks, which may satisfy the program.

Support for PowerMac floppy
CONFIG_MAC_FLOPPY
  If you have a SWIM-3 (Super Woz Integrated Machine 3; from Apple)
  floppy controller, say Y here. Most commonly found in PowerMacs.

RAM disk support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM
  Saying Y here will allow you to use a portion of your RAM memory as
  a block device, so that you can make file systems on it, read and
  write to it and do all the other things that you can do with normal
  block devices (such as hard drives). It is usually used to load and
  store a copy of a minimal root file system off of a floppy into RAM
  during the initial install of Linux.

  Note that the kernel command line option "ramdisk=XX" is now
  obsolete. For details, read <file:Documentation/ramdisk.txt>.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be
  called rd.o.

  Most normal users won't need the RAM disk functionality, and can
  thus say N here.

Default RAM disk size
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM_SIZE
  The default value is 4096. Only change this if you know what are
  you doing. If you are using IBM S/390, then set this to 8192.

Initial RAM disk (initrd) support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD
  The initial RAM disk is a RAM disk that is loaded by the boot loader
  (loadlin or lilo) and that is mounted as root before the normal boot
  procedure. It is typically used to load modules needed to mount the
  "real" root file system, etc. See <file:Documentation/initrd.txt>
  for details.

Embed root filesystem ramdisk into the kernel
CONFIG_EMBEDDED_RAMDISK
  Select this option if you want to build the ramdisk image into the
  the final kernel binary.

Filename of gziped ramdisk image
CONFIG_EMBEDDED_RAMDISK_IMAGE
  This is the filename of the ramdisk image to be built into the
  kernel.  Relative pathnames are relative to arch/mips/ramdisk/.
  The ramdisk image is not part of the kernel distribution; you must
  provide one yourself.

Loopback device support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP
  Saying Y here will allow you to use a regular file as a block
  device; you can then create a file system on that block device and
  mount it just as you would mount other block devices such as hard
  drive partitions, CD-ROM drives or floppy drives. The loop devices
  are block special device files with major number 7 and typically
  called /dev/loop0, /dev/loop1 etc.

  This is useful if you want to check an ISO 9660 file system before
  burning the CD, or if you want to use floppy images without first
  writing them to floppy. Furthermore, some Linux distributions avoid
  the need for a dedicated Linux partition by keeping their complete
  root file system inside a DOS FAT file using this loop device
  driver.

  The loop device driver can also be used to "hide" a file system in a
  disk partition, floppy, or regular file, either using encryption
  (scrambling the data) or steganography (hiding the data in the low
  bits of, say, a sound file). This is also safe if the file resides
  on a remote file server. If you want to do this, you will first have
  to acquire and install a kernel patch from
  <ftp://ftp.kerneli.org/pub/kerneli/>, and then you need to
  say Y to this option.

  Note that alternative ways to use encrypted file systems are
  provided by the cfs package, which can be gotten from
  <ftp://ftp.kerneli.org/pub/kerneli/net-source/>, and the newer tcfs
  package, available at <http://tcfs.dia.unisa.it/>. You do not need
  to say Y here if you want to use one of these. However, using cfs
  requires saying Y to "NFS file system support" below while using
  tcfs requires applying a kernel patch. An alternative steganography
  solution is provided by StegFS, also available from
  <ftp://ftp.kerneli.org/pub/kerneli/net-source/>.

  To use the loop device, you need the losetup utility and a recent
  version of the mount program, both contained in the util-linux
  package. The location and current version number of util-linux is
  contained in the file <file:Documentation/Changes>.

  Note that this loop device has nothing to do with the loopback
  device used for network connections from the machine to itself.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module
  will be called loop.o.

  Most users will answer N here.

Micro Memory MM5415 Battery Backed RAM support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_UMEM
  Saying Y here will include support for the MM5415 family of
  battery backed (Non-volatile) RAM cards.
  <http://www.umem.com/>

  The cards appear as block devices that can be partitioned into
  as many as 15 partitions.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt. The module will be
  called umem.o.

  The umem driver has been allocated block major number 116.
  See Documentation/devices.txt for recommended device naming.

Network block device support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_NBD
  Saying Y here will allow your computer to be a client for network
  block devices, i.e. it will be able to use block devices exported by
  servers (mount file systems on them etc.). Communication between
  client and server works over TCP/IP networking, but to the client
  program this is hidden: it looks like a regular local file access to
  a block device special file such as /dev/nd0.

  Network block devices also allows you to run a block-device in
  userland (making server and client physically the same computer,
  communicating using the loopback network device).

  Read <file:Documentation/nbd.txt> for more information, especially
  about where to find the server code, which runs in user space and
  does not need special kernel support.

  Note that this has nothing to do with the network file systems NFS
  or Coda; you can say N here even if you intend to use NFS or Coda.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module
  will be called nbd.o.

  If unsure, say N.

Per partition statistics in /proc/partitions
CONFIG_BLK_STATS
  If you say yes here, your kernel will keep statistical information
  for every partition. The information includes things as numbers of
  read and write accesses, the number of merged requests etc.

  This is required for the full functionality of sar(8) and interesting
  if you want to do performance tuning, by tweaking the elevator, e.g.

  If unsure, say N.

ATA/IDE/MFM/RLL support
CONFIG_IDE
  If you say Y here, your kernel will be able to manage low cost mass
  storage units such as ATA/(E)IDE and ATAPI units. The most common
  cases are IDE hard drives and ATAPI CD-ROM drives.

  If your system is pure SCSI and doesn't use these interfaces, you
  can say N here.

  Integrated Disk Electronics (IDE aka ATA-1) is a connecting standard
  for mass storage units such as hard disks. It was designed by
  Western Digital and Compaq Computer in 1984. It was then named
  ST506. Quite a number of disks use the IDE interface.

  AT Attachment (ATA) is the superset of the IDE specifications.
  ST506 was also called ATA-1.

  Fast-IDE is ATA-2 (also named Fast ATA), Enhanced IDE (EIDE) is
  ATA-3. It provides support for larger disks (up to 8.4GB by means of
  the LBA standard), more disks (4 instead of 2) and for other mass
  storage units such as tapes and cdrom. UDMA/33 (aka UltraDMA/33) is
  ATA-4 and provides faster (and more CPU friendly) transfer modes
  than previous PIO (Programmed processor Input/Output) from previous
  ATA/IDE standards by means of fast DMA controllers.

  ATA Packet Interface (ATAPI) is a protocol used by EIDE tape and
  CD-ROM drives, similar in many respects to the SCSI protocol.

  SMART IDE (Self Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) was
  designed in order to prevent data corruption and disk crash by
  detecting pre hardware failure conditions (heat, access time, and
  the like...). Disks built since June 1995 may follow this standard.
  The kernel itself don't manage this; however there are quite a
  number of user programs such as smart that can query the status of
  SMART parameters disk.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module
  will be called ide.o.

  For further information, please read <file:Documentation/ide.txt>.

  If unsure, say Y.

Enhanced IDE/MFM/RLL disk/cdrom/tape/floppy support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE
  If you say Y here, you will use the full-featured IDE driver to
  control up to ten ATA/IDE interfaces, each being able to serve a
  "master" and a "slave" device, for a total of up to twenty ATA/IDE
  disk/cdrom/tape/floppy drives.

  Useful information about large (>540 MB) IDE disks, multiple
  interfaces, what to do if ATA/IDE devices are not automatically
  detected, sound card ATA/IDE ports, module support, and other
  topics, is contained in <file:Documentation/ide.txt>. For detailed
  information about hard drives, consult the Disk-HOWTO and the
  Multi-Disk-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  To fine-tune ATA/IDE drive/interface parameters for improved
  performance, look for the hdparm package at
  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/hardware/>.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> and
  <file:Documentation/ide.txt>. The module will be called ide-mod.o.
  Do not compile this driver as a module if your root file system (the
  one containing the directory /) is located on an IDE device.

  If you have one or more IDE drives, say Y or M here. If your system
  has no IDE drives, or if memory requirements are really tight, you
  could say N here, and select the "Old hard disk driver" below
  instead to save about 13 KB of memory in the kernel.

Old hard disk (MFM/RLL/IDE) driver
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HD_ONLY
  There are two drivers for MFM/RLL/IDE hard disks. Most people use
  the newer enhanced driver, but this old one is still around for two
  reasons. Some older systems have strange timing problems and seem to
  work only with the old driver (which itself does not work with some
  newer systems). The other reason is that the old driver is smaller,
  since it lacks the enhanced functionality of the new one. This makes
  it a good choice for systems with very tight memory restrictions, or
  for systems with only older MFM/RLL/ESDI drives. Choosing the old
  driver can save 13 KB or so of kernel memory.

  If you are unsure, then just choose the Enhanced IDE/MFM/RLL driver
  instead of this one. For more detailed information, read the
  Disk-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

Use old disk-only driver on primary interface
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HD_IDE
  There are two drivers for MFM/RLL/IDE disks.  Most people use just
  the new enhanced driver by itself.  This option however installs the
  old hard disk driver to control the primary IDE/disk interface in
  the system, leaving the new enhanced IDE driver to take care of only
  the 2nd/3rd/4th IDE interfaces.  Doing this will prevent you from
  having an IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM or tape drive connected to the primary
  IDE interface.  Choosing this option may be useful for older systems
  which have MFM/RLL/ESDI controller+drives at the primary port
  address (0x1f0), along with IDE drives at the secondary/3rd/4th port
  addresses.

  Normally, just say N here; you will then use the new driver for all
  4 interfaces.

Include IDE/ATA-2 DISK support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDISK
  This will include enhanced support for MFM/RLL/IDE hard disks.  If
  you have a MFM/RLL/IDE disk, and there is no special reason to use
  the old hard disk driver instead, say Y.  If you have an SCSI-only
  system, you can say N here.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called ide-disk.o.  Do not compile this driver as a module
  if your root file system (the one containing the directory /) is
  located on the IDE disk. If unsure, say Y.

Use multi-mode by default
CONFIG_IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE
  If you get this error, try to say Y here:

  hda: set_multmode: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
  hda: set_multmode: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }

  If in doubt, say N.

PCMCIA IDE support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDECS
  Support for outboard IDE disks, tape drives, and CD-ROM drives
  connected through a  PCMCIA card.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  ide-cs.o

Include IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDECD
  If you have a CD-ROM drive using the ATAPI protocol, say Y. ATAPI is
  a newer protocol used by IDE CD-ROM and TAPE drives, similar to the
  SCSI protocol. Most new CD-ROM drives use ATAPI, including the
  NEC-260, Mitsumi FX400, Sony 55E, and just about all non-SCSI
  double(2X) or better speed drives.

  If you say Y here, the CD-ROM drive will be identified at boot time
  along with other IDE devices, as "hdb" or "hdc", or something
  similar (check the boot messages with dmesg). If this is your only
  CD-ROM drive, you can say N to all other CD-ROM options, but be sure
  to say Y or M to "ISO 9660 CD-ROM file system support".

  Note that older versions of LILO (LInux LOader) cannot properly deal
  with IDE/ATAPI CD-ROMs, so install LILO 16 or higher, available from
  <ftp://brun.dyndns.org/pub/linux/lilo/>.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called ide-cd.o.

Include IDE/ATAPI TAPE support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDETAPE
  If you have an IDE tape drive using the ATAPI protocol, say Y.
  ATAPI is a newer protocol used by IDE tape and CD-ROM drives,
  similar to the SCSI protocol.  If you have an SCSI tape drive
  however, you can say N here.

  You should also say Y if you have an OnStream DI-30 tape drive; this
  will not work with the SCSI protocol, until there is support for the
  SC-30 and SC-50 versions.

  If you say Y here, the tape drive will be identified at boot time
  along with other IDE devices, as "hdb" or "hdc", or something
  similar, and will be mapped to a character device such as "ht0"
  (check the boot messages with dmesg).  Be sure to consult the
  <file:drivers/ide/ide-tape.c> and <file:Documentation/ide.txt> files
  for usage information.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called ide-tape.o.

Include IDE/ATAPI FLOPPY support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEFLOPPY
  If you have an IDE floppy drive which uses the ATAPI protocol,
  answer Y.  ATAPI is a newer protocol used by IDE CD-ROM/tape/floppy
  drives, similar to the SCSI protocol.

  The LS-120 and the IDE/ATAPI Iomega ZIP drive are also supported by
  this driver. For information about jumper settings and the question
  of when a ZIP drive uses a partition table, see
  <http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/zip/zip-1.html>.
  (ATAPI PD-CD/CDR drives are not supported by this driver; support
  for PD-CD/CDR drives is available if you answer Y to
  "SCSI emulation support", below).

  If you say Y here, the FLOPPY drive will be identified along with
  other IDE devices, as "hdb" or "hdc", or something similar (check
  the boot messages with dmesg).

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called ide-floppy.o.

AWARD Bios Work-Around
CONFIG_IDEDISK_STROKE
  Should you have a system w/ an AWARD Bios and your drives are larger
  than 32GB and it will not boot, one is required to perform a few OEM
  operations first.  The option is called "STROKE" because it allows
  one to "soft clip" the drive to work around a barrier limit.  For
  Maxtor drives it is called "jumpon.exe".  Please search Maxtor's
  web-site for "JUMPON.EXE".  IBM has a similar tool at:
  <http://www.storage.ibm.com/hdd/support/download.htm>.

  If you are unsure, say N here.

Raw Access to Media
CONFIG_IDE_TASK_IOCTL
  This is a direct raw access to the media.  It is a complex but
  elegant solution to test and validate the domain of the hardware and
  perform below the driver data recover if needed.  This is the most
  basic form of media-forensics.

  If you are unsure, say N here.

Use Taskfile I/O
CONFIG_IDE_TASKFILE_IO
  This is the "Jewel" of the patch.  It will go away and become the new
  driver core.  Since all the chipsets/host side hardware deal w/ their
  exceptions in "their local code" currently, adoption of a
  standardized data-transport is the only logical solution.
  Additionally we packetize the requests and gain rapid performance and
  a reduction in system latency.  Additionally by using a memory struct
  for the commands we can redirect to a MMIO host hardware in the next
  generation of controllers, specifically second generation Ultra133
  and Serial ATA.

  Since this is a major transition, it was deemed necessary to make the
  driver paths buildable in separate models.  Therefore if using this
  option fails for your arch then we need to address the needs for that
  arch.

  If you want to test this functionality, say Y here.

Force DMA
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_FORCED
  This is an old piece of lost code from Linux 2.0 Kernels.

  Generally say N here.

DMA Only on Disks
CONFIG_IDEDMA_ONLYDISK
  This is used if you know your ATAPI Devices are going to fail DMA
  Transfers.

  Generally say N here.

SCSI emulation support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDESCSI
  This will provide SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices,
  and will allow you to use a SCSI device driver instead of a native
  ATAPI driver.

  This is useful if you have an ATAPI device for which no native
  driver has been written (for example, an ATAPI PD-CD or CDR drive);
  you can then use this emulation together with an appropriate SCSI
  device driver. In order to do this, say Y here and to "SCSI support"
  and "SCSI generic support", below. You must then provide the kernel
  command line "hdx=scsi" (try "man bootparam" or see the
  documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to
  pass options to the kernel at boot time) for devices if you want the
  native EIDE sub-drivers to skip over the native support, so that
  this SCSI emulation can be used instead. This is required for use of
  CD-RW's.

  Note that this option does NOT allow you to attach SCSI devices to a
  box that doesn't have a SCSI host adapter installed.

  If both this SCSI emulation and native ATAPI support are compiled
  into the kernel, the native support will be used.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  ide-scsi.o

Use the NOOP Elevator (WARNING)
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ELEVATOR_NOOP
  If you are using a raid class top-level driver above the ATA/IDE core,
  one may find a performance boost by preventing a merging and re-sorting
  of the new requests.

  If unsure, say N.

ISA-PNP EIDE support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ISAPNP
  If you have an ISA EIDE card that is PnP (Plug and Play) and
  requires setup first before scanning for devices, say Y here.

  If unsure, say N.

CMD640 chipset bugfix/support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CMD640
  The CMD-Technologies CMD640 IDE chip is used on many common 486 and
  Pentium motherboards, usually in combination with a "Neptune" or
  "SiS" chipset. Unfortunately, it has a number of rather nasty
  design flaws that can cause severe data corruption under many common
  conditions. Say Y here to include code which tries to automatically
  detect and correct the problems under Linux. This option also
  enables access to the secondary IDE ports in some CMD640 based
  systems.

  This driver will work automatically in PCI based systems (most new
  systems have PCI slots). But if your system uses VESA local bus
  (VLB) instead of PCI, you must also supply a kernel boot parameter
  to enable the CMD640 bugfix/support: "ide0=cmd640_vlb". (Try "man
  bootparam" or see the documentation of your boot loader about how to
  pass options to the kernel.)

  The CMD640 chip is also used on add-in cards by Acculogic, and on
  the "CSA-6400E PCI to IDE controller" that some people have. For
  details, read <file:Documentation/ide.txt>.

CMD640 enhanced support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CMD640_ENHANCED
  This option includes support for setting/autotuning PIO modes and
  prefetch on CMD640 IDE interfaces.  For details, read
  <file:Documentation/ide.txt>. If you have a CMD640 IDE interface
  and your BIOS does not already do this for you, then say Y here.
  Otherwise say N.

RZ1000 chipset bugfix/support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RZ1000
  The PC-Technologies RZ1000 IDE chip is used on many common 486 and
  Pentium motherboards, usually along with the "Neptune" chipset.
  Unfortunately, it has a rather nasty design flaw that can cause
  severe data corruption under many conditions. Say Y here to include
  code which automatically detects and corrects the problem under
  Linux. This may slow disk throughput by a few percent, but at least
  things will operate 100% reliably.

Generic PCI IDE chipset support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI
  Say Y here for PCI systems which use IDE drive(s).
  This option helps the IDE driver to automatically detect and
  configure all PCI-based IDE interfaces in your system.

Support for sharing PCI IDE interrupts
CONFIG_IDEPCI_SHARE_IRQ
  Some ATA/IDE chipsets have hardware support which allows for
  sharing a single IRQ with other cards. To enable support for
  this in the ATA/IDE driver, say Y here.

  It is safe to say Y to this question, in most cases.
  If unsure, say N.

Generic PCI bus-master DMA support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI
  If your PCI system uses IDE drive(s) (as opposed to SCSI, say) and
  is capable of bus-master DMA operation (most Pentium PCI systems),
  you will want to say Y here to reduce CPU overhead. You can then use
  the "hdparm" utility to enable DMA for drives for which it was not
  enabled automatically. By default, DMA is not enabled automatically
  for these drives, but you can change that by saying Y to the
  following question "Use DMA by default when available". You can get
  the latest version of the hdparm utility from
  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/hardware/>.

  Read the comments at the beginning of <file:drivers/ide/ide-dma.c>
  and the file <file:Documentation/ide.txt> for more information.

  It is safe to say Y to this question.

Good-Bad DMA Model-Firmware (WIP)
CONFIG_IDEDMA_NEW_DRIVE_LISTINGS
  If you say Y here, the model and firmware revision of your drive
  will be compared against a blacklist of buggy drives that claim to
  be (U)DMA capable but aren't. This is a blanket on/off test with no
  speed limit options.

  Straight GNU GCC 2.7.3/2.8.X compilers are known to be safe;
  whereas, many versions of EGCS have a problem and miscompile if you
  say Y here.

  If in doubt, say N.

Attempt to HACK around Chipsets that TIMEOUT (WIP)
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_TIMEOUT
  If you say Y here, this is a NASTY UGLY HACK!

  We have to issue an abort and requeue the request DMA engine got
  turned off by a goofy ASIC, and we have to clean up the mess, and
  here is as good as any.  Do it globally for all chipsets.

  If in doubt, say N.

Boot off-board chipsets first support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_OFFBOARD
  Normally, IDE controllers built into the motherboard (on-board
  controllers) are assigned to ide0 and ide1 while those on add-in PCI
  cards (off-board controllers) are relegated to ide2 and ide3.
  Answering Y here will allow you to reverse the situation, with
  off-board controllers on ide0/1 and on-board controllers on ide2/3.
  This can improve the usability of some boot managers such as lilo
  when booting from a drive on an off-board controller.

  If you say Y here, and you actually want to reverse the device scan
  order as explained above, you also need to issue the kernel command
  line option "ide=reverse". (Try "man bootparam" or see the
  documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to
  pass options to the kernel at boot time.)

  Note that, if you do this, the order of the hd* devices will be
  rearranged which may require modification of fstab and other files.

  If in doubt, say N.

Use PCI DMA by default when available
CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_AUTO
  Prior to kernel version 2.1.112, Linux used to automatically use
  DMA for IDE drives and chipsets which support it. Due to concerns
  about a couple of cases where buggy hardware may have caused damage,
  the default is now to NOT use DMA automatically. To revert to the
  previous behaviour, say Y to this question.

  If you suspect your hardware is at all flakey, say N here.
  Do NOT email the IDE kernel people regarding this issue!

  It is normally safe to answer Y to this question unless your
  motherboard uses a VIA VP2 chipset, in which case you should say N.

IGNORE word93 Validation BITS
CONFIG_IDEDMA_IVB
  There are unclear terms in ATA-4 and ATA-5 standards how certain
  hardware (an 80c ribbon) should be detected. Different interpretations
  of the standards have been released in hardware. This causes problems:
  for example, a host with Ultra Mode 4 (or higher) will not run
  in that mode with an 80c ribbon.

  If you are experiencing compatibility or performance problems, you
  MAY try to answering Y here. However, it does not necessarily solve
  any of your problems, it could even cause more of them.

  It is normally safe to answer Y; however, the default is N.

ATA Work(s) In Progress (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_WIP
  If you enable this you will be able to use and test highly
  developmental projects. If you say N, the configurator will
  simply skip those options.

  It is SAFEST to say N to this question.

Asynchronous DMA support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ADMA
  Please read the comments at the top of
  <file:drivers/ide/ide-adma.c>.

Pacific Digital A-DMA support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PDC_ADMA
  Please read the comments at the top of <file:drivers/ide/ide-pci.c>.

3ware Hardware ATA-RAID support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_3W_XXXX_RAID
  3ware is the only hardware ATA-Raid product in Linux to date.
  This card is 2,4, or 8 channel master mode support only.
  SCSI support required!!!

  <http://www.3ware.com/>

  Please read the comments at the top of
  <file:drivers/scsi/3w-xxxx.c>.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called 3w-xxxx.o.

AEC62XX chipset support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_AEC62XX
  This driver adds up to 4 more EIDE devices sharing a single
  interrupt. This add-on card is a bootable PCI UDMA controller. In
  order to get this card to initialize correctly in some cases, you
  should say Y here, and preferably also to "Use DMA by default when
  available".

  The ATP850U/UF is an UltraDMA 33 chipset base.
  The ATP860 is an UltraDMA 66 chipset base.
  The ATP860M(acintosh) version is an UltraDMA 66 chipset base.

  Please read the comments at the top of <file:drivers/ide/aec62xx.c>.
  If you say Y here, then say Y to "Use DMA by default when available"
  as well.

AEC62XX Tuning support
CONFIG_AEC62XX_TUNING
  Please read the comments at the top of <file:drivers/ide/aec62xx.c>.
  If unsure, say N.

ALI M15x3 chipset support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ALI15X3
  This driver ensures (U)DMA support for ALI 1533, 1543 and 1543C
  onboard chipsets.  It also tests for Simplex mode and enables
  normal dual channel support.

  If you say Y here, you also need to say Y to "Use DMA by default
  when available", above.  Please read the comments at the top of
  <file:drivers/ide/alim15x3.c>.

  If unsure, say N.

ALI M15x3 WDC support (DANGEROUS)
CONFIG_WDC_ALI15X3
  This allows for UltraDMA support for WDC drives that ignore CRC
  checking. You are a fool for enabling this option, but there have
  been requests. DO NOT COMPLAIN IF YOUR DRIVE HAS FS CORRUPTION, IF
  YOU ENABLE THIS! No one will listen, just laugh for ignoring this
  SERIOUS WARNING.

  Using this option can allow WDC drives to run at ATA-4/5 transfer
  rates with only an ATA-2 support structure.

  SAY N!

AMD Viper (7401/7409/7411) chipset support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_AMD74XX
  This driver ensures (U)DMA support for the AMD756/760 Viper
  chipsets.

  If you say Y here, you also need to say Y to "Use DMA by default
  when available", above.
  Please read the comments at the top of <file:drivers/ide/amd74xx.c>.

  If unsure, say N.

AMD Viper ATA-66 Override support (WIP)
CONFIG_AMD74XX_OVERRIDE
  This option auto-forces the ata66 flag.
  This effect can be also invoked by calling "idex=ata66"
  If unsure, say N.

CMD64X and CMD680 chipset support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CMD64X
  Say Y here if you have an IDE controller which uses any of these
  chipsets: CMD643, CMD646, CMD648, CMD649 or CMD680.

CY82C693 chipset support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CY82C693
  This driver adds detection and support for the CY82C693 chipset
  used on Digital's PC-Alpha 164SX boards.

  If you say Y here, you need to say Y to "Use DMA by default
  when available" as well.

Cyrix CS5530 MediaGX chipset support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CS5530
  Include support for UDMA on the Cyrix MediaGX 5530 chipset. This
  will automatically be detected and configured if found.

  It is safe to say Y to this question.

  People with SCSI-only systems should say N here. If unsure, say Y.

HPT34X chipset support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HPT34X
  This driver adds up to 4 more EIDE devices sharing a single
  interrupt. The HPT343 chipset in its current form is a non-bootable
  controller; the HPT345/HPT363 chipset is a bootable (needs BIOS FIX)
  PCI UDMA controllers. This driver requires dynamic tuning of the
  chipset during the ide-probe at boot time. It is reported to support
  DVD II drives, by the manufacturer.

HPT34X AUTODMA support (WIP)
CONFIG_HPT34X_AUTODMA
  This is a dangerous thing to attempt currently! Please read the
  comments at the top of <file:drivers/ide/hpt34x.c>.  If you say Y
  here, then say Y to "Use DMA by default when available" as well.

  If unsure, say N.

HPT366/368/370 chipset support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HPT366
  HPT366 is an Ultra DMA chipset for ATA-66.
  HPT368 is an Ultra DMA chipset for ATA-66 RAID Based.
  HPT370 is an Ultra DMA chipset for ATA-100.

  This driver adds up to 4 more EIDE devices sharing a single
  interrupt.

  The HPT366 chipset in its current form is bootable. One solution
  for this problem are special LILO commands for redirecting the
  reference to device 0x80. The other solution is to say Y to "Boot
  off-board chipsets first support" (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_OFFBOARD) unless
  your mother board has the chipset natively mounted. Regardless one
  should use the fore mentioned option and call at LILO or include
  "ide=reverse" in LILO's append-line.

  This driver requires dynamic tuning of the chipset during the
  ide-probe at boot. It is reported to support DVD II drives, by the
  manufacturer.

NS87415 chipset support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_NS87415
  This driver adds detection and support for the NS87415 chip
  (used in SPARC64, among others).

  Please read the comments at the top of <file:drivers/ide/ns87415.c>.

OPTi 82C621 chipset enhanced support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_OPTI621
  This is a driver for the OPTi 82C621 EIDE controller.
  Please read the comments at the top of <file:drivers/ide/opti621.c>.

ServerWorks OSB4/CSB5 chipset support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SVWKS
  This driver adds PIO/(U)DMA support for the ServerWorks OSB4/CSB5
  chipsets.

Intel PIIXn chipsets support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PIIX
  This driver adds PIO mode setting and tuning for all PIIX IDE
  controllers by Intel.  Since the BIOS can sometimes improperly tune
  PIO 0-4 mode settings, this allows dynamic tuning of the chipset
  via the standard end-user tool 'hdparm'.

  Please read the comments at the top of <file:drivers/ide/piix.c>.

  If you say Y here, you should also say Y to "PIIXn Tuning support",
  below.

  If unsure, say N.

PIIXn Tuning support
CONFIG_PIIX_TUNING
  This driver extension adds DMA mode setting and tuning for all PIIX
  IDE controllers by Intel. Since the BIOS can sometimes improperly
  set up the device/adapter combination and speed limits, it has
  become a necessity to back/forward speed devices as needed.

  Case 430HX/440FX PIIX3 need speed limits to reduce UDMA to DMA mode
  2 if the BIOS can not perform this task at initialization.

  If unsure, say N.

PROMISE PDC20246/PDC20262/PDC20265/PDC20267/PDC20268 support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PDC202XX
  Promise Ultra33 or PDC20246
  Promise Ultra66 or PDC20262
  Promise Ultra100 or PDC20265/PDC20267/PDC20268

  This driver adds up to 4 more EIDE devices sharing a single
  interrupt. This add-on card is a bootable PCI UDMA controller. Since
  multiple cards can be installed and there are BIOS ROM problems that
  happen if the BIOS revisions of all installed cards (three-max) do
  not match, the driver attempts to do dynamic tuning of the chipset
  at boot-time for max-speed.  Ultra33 BIOS 1.25 or newer is required
  for more than one card. This card may require that you say Y to
  "Special UDMA Feature".

  If you say Y here, you need to say Y to "Use DMA by default when
  available" as well.

  Please read the comments at the top of
  <file:drivers/ide/pdc202xx.c>.

  If unsure, say N.

Special UDMA Feature
CONFIG_PDC202XX_BURST
  This option causes the pdc202xx driver to enable UDMA modes on the
  PDC202xx even when the PDC202xx BIOS has not done so.

  It was originally designed for the PDC20246/Ultra33, whose BIOS will
  only setup UDMA on the first two PDC20246 cards.  It has also been
  used successfully on a PDC20265/Ultra100, allowing use of UDMA modes
  when the PDC20265 BIOS has been disabled (for faster boot up).

  Please read the comments at the top of
  <file:drivers/ide/pdc202xx.c>.

  If unsure, say N.

Special FastTrak Feature
CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE
  For FastTrak enable overriding BIOS.

SiS5513 chipset support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SIS5513
  This driver ensures (U)DMA support for SIS5513 chipset family based
  mainboards.

  purposes) into a volume group.  Imagine a volume group as a kind of
  virtual disk. Logical volumes, which can be thought of as virtual
  partitions, can be created in the volume group.  You can resize
  volume groups and logical volumes after creation time, corresponding
  to new capacity needs.  Logical volumes are accessed as block
  devices named /dev/VolumeGroupName/LogicalVolumeName.

  For details see <file:Documentation/LVM-HOWTO>.  You will need

Multiple devices driver support (RAID and LVM)
CONFIG_MD
  Support multiple physical spindles through a single logical device.
  Required for RAID and logical volume management (LVM).

Multiple devices driver support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_MD
  This driver lets you combine several hard disk partitions into one
  logical block device. This can be used to simply append one
  partition to another one or to combine several redundant hard disks
  into a RAID1/4/5 device so as to provide protection against hard
  disk failures. This is called "Software RAID" since the combining of
  the partitions is done by the kernel. "Hardware RAID" means that the
  combining is done by a dedicated controller; if you have such a
  controller, you do not need to say Y here.

  More information about Software RAID on Linux is contained in the
  Software RAID mini-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. There you will also learn
  where to get the supporting user space utilities raidtools.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called linear.o.

  If unsure, say Y.

RAID-0 (striping) mode
CONFIG_MD_RAID0
  If you say Y here, then your multiple devices driver will be able to
  use the so-called raid0 mode, i.e. it will combine the hard disk
  partitions into one logical device in such a fashion as to fill them
  up evenly, one chunk here and one chunk there. This will increase
  the throughput rate if the partitions reside on distinct disks.

  Information about Software RAID on Linux is contained in the
  Software-RAID mini-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. There you will also
  learn where to get the supporting user space utilities raidtools.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called raid0.o.

  If unsure, say Y.

RAID-1 (mirroring) mode
CONFIG_MD_RAID1
  A RAID-1 set consists of several disk drives which are exact copies
  of each other.  In the event of a mirror failure, the RAID driver
  will continue to use the operational mirrors in the set, providing
  an error free MD (multiple device) to the higher levels of the
  kernel.  In a set with N drives, the available space is the capacity
  of a single drive, and the set protects against a failure of (N - 1)
  drives.

  Information about Software RAID on Linux is contained in the
  Software-RAID mini-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  There you will also
  learn where to get the supporting user space utilities raidtools.

  If you want to use such a RAID-1 set, say Y. This code is also
  available as a module called raid1.o ( = code which can be inserted
  in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).  If you
  want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If unsure, say Y.

RAID-4/RAID-5 mode
CONFIG_MD_RAID5
  A RAID-5 set of N drives with a capacity of C MB per drive provides
  the capacity of C * (N - 1) MB, and protects against a failure
  of a single drive. For a given sector (row) number, (N - 1) drives
  contain data sectors, and one drive contains the parity protection.
  For a RAID-4 set, the parity blocks are present on a single drive,
  while a RAID-5 set distributes the parity across the drives in one
  of the available parity distribution methods.

  Software-RAID mini-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. There you will also
  learn where to get the supporting user space utilities raidtools.

  If you want to use such a RAID-4/RAID-5 set, say Y. This code is

  If unsure, say Y.

Multipath I/O support
CONFIG_MD_MULTIPATH
  Multipath-IO is the ability of certain devices to address the same
  physical disk over multiple 'IO paths'. The code ensures that such
  paths can be defined and handled at runtime, and ensures that a
  transparent failover to the backup path(s) happens if a IO errors
  arrives on the primary path.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  multipath.o

  If unsure, say N.

Support for IDE Raid controllers
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ATARAID
  Say Y or M if you have an IDE Raid controller and want linux
  to use its softwareraid feature.  You must also select an
  appropriate for your board low-level driver below.

  Note, that Linux does not use the Raid implementation in BIOS, and
  the main purpose for this feature is to retain compatibility and
  data integrity with other OS-es, using the same disk array. Linux
  has its own Raid drivers, which you should use if you need better
  performance.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  ataraid.o

# Choice: mipstype
CPU type
CONFIG_CPU_R3000
  Please make sure to pick the right CPU type. Linux/MIPS is not
  designed to be generic, i.e. Kernels compiled for R3000 CPUs will
  *not* work on R4000 machines and vice versa.  However, since most
  of the supported machines have an R4000 (or similar) CPU, R4x00
  might be a safe bet.  If the resulting kernel does not work,
  try to recompile with R3000.

  for architectures which are either NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access)
  or have huge holes in the physical address space for other reasons.
  See <file:Documentation/vm/numa> for more.

Mapped kernel support
CONFIG_MAPPED_KERNEL
  Change the way a Linux kernel is loaded unto memory on a MIPS64
  machine.  This is required in order to support text replication and
  NUMA.  If you need to understand it, read the source code.

Kernel text replication support
CONFIG_REPLICATE_KTEXT
  Say Y here to enable replicating the kernel text across multiple
  nodes in a NUMA cluster.  This trades memory for speed.

Exception handler replication support
CONFIG_REPLICATE_EXHANDLERS
  Say Y here to enable replicating the kernel exception handlers
  across multiple nodes in a NUMA cluster. This trades memory for
  speed.

NUMA support?
CONFIG_NUMA
  Say Y to compile the kernel to support NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory
  Access).  This option is for configuring high-end multiprocessor
  server machines.  If in doubt, say N.

R41xx
CONFIG_CPU_VR41XX
  The options selects support for the NEC VR41xx series of processors.
  Only choose this option if you have one of these processors as a
  kernel built with this option will not run on any other type of
  processor or vice versa.

CPU feature configuration
CONFIG_CPU_ADVANCED
  Saying yes here allows you to select support for various features
  your CPU may or may not have.  Most people should say N here.

ll and sc instructions available
CONFIG_CPU_HAS_LLSC
  MIPS R4000 series and later provide the Load Linked (ll)
  and Store Conditional (sc) instructions. More information is
  available at <http://www.go-ecs.com/mips/miptek1.htm>.

  Say Y here if your CPU has the ll and sc instructions.  Say Y here
  for better performance, N if you don't know.  You must say Y here
  for multiprocessor machines.

lld and scd instructions available
CONFIG_CPU_HAS_LLDSCD
  Say Y here if your CPU has the lld and scd instructions, the 64-bit
  equivalents of ll and sc.  Say Y here for better performance, N if
  you don't know.  You must say Y here for multiprocessor machines.

Writeback Buffer available
CONFIG_CPU_HAS_WB
  Say N here for slightly better performance.  You must say Y here for
  machines which require flushing of write buffers in software.  Saying
  Y is the safe option; N may result in kernel malfunction and crashes.

Support for large 64-bit configurations
CONFIG_MIPS_INSANE_LARGE
  MIPS R10000 does support a 44 bit / 16TB address space as opposed to
  previous 64-bit processors which only supported 40 bit / 1TB. If you
  need processes of more than 1TB virtual address space, say Y here.
  This will result in additional memory usage, so it is not
  recommended for normal users.

Generate little endian code
CONFIG_CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN
  Some MIPS machines can be configured for either little or big endian
  byte order. These modes require different kernels. Say Y if your
  machine is little endian, N if it's a big endian machine.

Use power LED as a heartbeat
CONFIG_HEARTBEAT
  Use the power-on LED on your machine as a load meter.  The exact
  behaviour is platform-dependent, but normally the flash frequency is
  a hyperbolic function of the 5-minute load average.

Networking support
CONFIG_NET
  Unless you really know what you are doing, you should say Y here.
  The reason is that some programs need kernel networking support even
  when running on a stand-alone machine that isn't connected to any
  other computer. If you are upgrading from an older kernel, you
  should consider updating your networking tools too because changes
  in the kernel and the tools often go hand in hand. The tools are
  contained in the package net-tools, the location and version number
  of which are given in <file:Documentation/Changes>.

  For a general introduction to Linux networking, it is highly
  recommended to read the NET-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

Socket filtering
CONFIG_FILTER
  The Linux Socket Filter is derived from the Berkeley Packet Filter.
  If you say Y here, user-space programs can attach a filter to any
  socket and thereby tell the kernel that it should allow or disallow
  certain types of data to get through the socket.  Linux Socket
  Filtering works on all socket types except TCP for now.  See the
  text file <file:Documentation/networking/filter.txt> for more
  information.

  You need to say Y here if you want to use PPP packet filtering
  (see the CONFIG_PPP_FILTER option below).

  If unsure, say N.

Network packet filtering (replaces ipchains)
CONFIG_NETFILTER
  Netfilter is a framework for filtering and mangling network packets
  that pass through your Linux box.

  The most common use of packet filtering is to run your Linux box as
  a firewall protecting a local network from the Internet. The type of
  firewall provided by this kernel support is called a "packet
  filter", which means that it can reject individual network packets
  based on type, source, destination etc. The other kind of firewall,
  a "proxy-based" one, is more secure but more intrusive and more
  bothersome to set up; it inspects the network traffic much more
  closely, modifies it and has knowledge about the higher level
  protocols, which a packet filter lacks. Moreover, proxy-based
  firewalls often require changes to the programs running on the local
  clients. Proxy-based firewalls don't need support by the kernel, but
  they are often combined with a packet filter, which only works if
  you say Y here.

  You should also say Y here if you intend to use your Linux box as
  the gateway to the Internet for a local network of machines without
  globally valid IP addresses. This is called "masquerading": if one
  of the computers on your local network wants to send something to
  the outside, your box can "masquerade" as that computer, i.e. it
  forwards the traffic to the intended outside destination, but
  modifies the packets to make it look like they came from the
  firewall box itself. It works both ways: if the outside host
  replies, the Linux box will silently forward the traffic to the
  correct local computer. This way, the computers on your local net
  are completely invisible to the outside world, even though they can
  reach the outside and can receive replies. It is even possible to
  run globally visible servers from within a masqueraded local network
  using a mechanism called portforwarding. Masquerading is also often
  called NAT (Network Address Translation).

  Another use of Netfilter is in transparent proxying: if a machine on
  the local network tries to connect to an outside host, your Linux
  box can transparently forward the traffic to a local server,
  typically a caching proxy server.

  Various modules exist for netfilter which replace the previous
  masquerading (ipmasqadm), packet filtering (ipchains), transparent
  proxying, and portforwarding mechanisms. Please see
  <file:Documentation/Changes> under "iptables" for the location of
  these packages.

  Make sure to say N to "Fast switching" below if you intend to say Y
  here, as Fast switching currently bypasses netfilter.

  Chances are that you should say Y here if you compile a kernel which
  will run as a router and N for regular hosts. If unsure, say N.

Network packet filtering debugging
CONFIG_NETFILTER_DEBUG
  You can say Y here if you want to get additional messages useful in
  debugging the netfilter code.

Connection tracking (required for masq/NAT)
CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK
  Connection tracking keeps a record of what packets have passed
  through your machine, in order to figure out how they are related
  into connections.

  This is required to do Masquerading or other kinds of Network
  Address Translation (except for Fast NAT).  It can also be used to
  enhance packet filtering (see `Connection state match support'
  below).

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

IRC Send/Chat protocol support
CONFIG_IP_NF_IRC
  There is a commonly-used extension to IRC called
  Direct Client-to-Client Protocol (DCC).  This enables users to send
  files to each other, and also chat to each other without the need
  of a server.  DCC Sending is used anywhere you send files over IRC,
  and DCC Chat is most commonly used by Eggdrop bots.  If you are
  using NAT, this extension will enable you to send files and initiate
  chats.  Note that you do NOT need this extension to get files or
  have others initiate chats, or everything else in IRC.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say 'M' here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say 'N'.

FTP protocol support
CONFIG_IP_NF_FTP
  Tracking FTP connections is problematic: special helpers are
  required for tracking them, and doing masquerading and other forms
  of Network Address Translation on them.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `Y'.

User space queueing via NETLINK
CONFIG_IP_NF_QUEUE
  Netfilter has the ability to queue packets to user space: the
  netlink device can be used to access them using this driver.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

IP tables support (required for filtering/masq/NAT)
CONFIG_IP_NF_IPTABLES
  iptables is a general, extensible packet identification framework.
  The packet filtering and full NAT (masquerading, port forwarding,
  etc) subsystems now use this: say 'Y' or 'M' here if you want to use
  either of those.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

RTSP protocol support
CONFIG_IP_NF_RTSP
  Support the RTSP protocol.  This allows UDP transports to be setup
  properly, including RTP and RDT.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say 'M' here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say 'Y'.

limit match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_LIMIT
  limit matching allows you to control the rate at which a rule can be
  matched: mainly useful in combination with the LOG target ("LOG
  target support", below) and to avoid some Denial of Service attacks.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

skb->pkt_type packet match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_PKTTYPE
  This patch allows you to match packet in accrodance
  to its "class", eg. BROADCAST, MULTICAST, ...
  
  Typical usage:
  iptables -A INPUT -m pkttype --pkt-type broadcast -j LOG
  
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.

MAC address match support

  `nfmark' value in the packet.  This can be set by the MARK target
  (see below).

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

Multiple port match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_MULTIPORT
  Multiport matching allows you to match TCP or UDP packets based on
  a series of source or destination ports: normally a rule can only
  match a single range of ports.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

TTL match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TTL
  This adds CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TTL option, which enabled the user
  to match packets by their TTL value.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.

LENGTH match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_LENGTH
  This option allows you to match the length of a packet against a
  specific value or range of values.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

AH/ESP match support

  These two match extensions (`ah' and `esp') allow you to match a
  range of SPIs inside AH or ESP headers of IPSec packets.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.

DSCP match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_DSCP

  This option adds a `ECN' match, which allows you to match against
  the IPv4 and TCP header ECN fields.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.

 

TOS match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TOS
  TOS matching allows you to match packets based on the Type Of
  Service fields of the IP packet.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

conntrack match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_CONNTRACK
  This is a general conntrack match module, a superset of the state match.

  It allows matching on additional conntrack information, which is
  useful in complex configurations, such as NAT gateways with multiple
  internet links or tunnels.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.


Connection state match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_STATE
  Connection state matching allows you to match packets based on their
  relationship to a tracked connection (ie. previous packets).  This
  is a powerful tool for packet classification.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

Unclean match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_UNCLEAN
  Unclean packet matching matches any strange or invalid packets, by
  looking at a series of fields in the IP, TCP, UDP and ICMP headers.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

Owner match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_OWNER
  Packet owner matching allows you to match locally-generated packets
  based on who created them: the user, group, process or session.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

Packet filtering
CONFIG_IP_NF_FILTER
  Packet filtering defines a table `filter', which has a series of
  rules for simple packet filtering at local input, forwarding and
  local output.  See the man page for iptables(8).

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

REJECT target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_REJECT
  The REJECT target allows a filtering rule to specify that an ICMP
  error should be issued in response to an incoming packet, rather
  than silently being dropped.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

MIRROR target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_MIRROR
  The MIRROR target allows a filtering rule to specify that an
  incoming packet should be bounced back to the sender.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

Local NAT support
CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT_LOCAL
  This option enables support for NAT of locally originated connections. 
  Enable this if you need to use destination NAT on connections
  originating from local processes on the nat box itself.

  Please note that you will need a recent version (>= 1.2.6a)
  of the iptables userspace program in order to use this feature.
  See <http://www.iptables.org/> for download instructions.

  If unsure, say 'N'.


Full NAT (Network Address Translation)
CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT
  The Full NAT option allows masquerading, port forwarding and other
  forms of full Network Address Port Translation.  It is controlled by
  the `nat' table in iptables: see the man page for iptables(8).

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

MASQUERADE target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_MASQUERADE
  Masquerading is a special case of NAT: all outgoing connections are
  changed to seem to come from a particular interface's address, and
  if the interface goes down, those connections are lost.  This is
  only useful for dialup accounts with dynamic IP address (ie. your IP
  address will be different on next dialup).

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

Basic SNMP-ALG support
CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT_SNMP_BASIC

  This module implements an Application Layer Gateway (ALG) for
  SNMP payloads.  In conjunction with NAT, it allows a network
  management system to access multiple private networks with
  conflicting addresses.  It works by modifying IP addresses
  inside SNMP payloads to match IP-layer NAT mapping.

  This is the "basic" form of SNMP-ALG, as described in RFC 2962

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

REDIRECT target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_REDIRECT
  REDIRECT is a special case of NAT: all incoming connections are
  mapped onto the incoming interface's address, causing the packets to
  come to the local machine instead of passing through.  This is
  useful for transparent proxies.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

Packet mangling
CONFIG_IP_NF_MANGLE
  This option adds a `mangle' table to iptables: see the man page for
  iptables(8).  This table is used for various packet alterations
  which can effect how the packet is routed.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

DSCP target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_DSCP
  This option adds a `DSCP' target, which allows you to create rules in
  the iptables mangle table. The selected packet has the DSCP field set
  to the hex value provided on the command line; unlike the TOS target
  which will only set the legal values within ip.h.

  The DSCP field can be set to any value between 0x0 and 0x4f. It does
  take into account that bits 6 and 7 are used by ECN.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.

 

ECN target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_ECN
  This option adds a `ECN' target, which can be used in the iptables mangle
  table.  

  You can use this target to remove the ECN bits from the IPv4 header of
  an IP packet.  This is particularly useful, if you need to work around
  existing ECN blackholes on the internet, but don't want to disable
  ECN support in general.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.

 

TOS target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_TOS
  This option adds a `TOS' target, which allows you to create rules in
  the `mangle' table which alter the Type Of Service field of an IP
  packet prior to routing.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

MARK target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_MARK
  This option adds a `MARK' target, which allows you to create rules
  in the `mangle' table which alter the netfilter mark (nfmark) field
  associated with the packet prior to routing. This can change
  the routing method (see `Use netfilter MARK value as routing
  key') and can also be used by other subsystems to change their
  behaviour.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

TCPMSS target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_TCPMSS
  This option adds a `TCPMSS' target, which allows you to alter the
  MSS value of TCP SYN packets, to control the maximum size for that
  connection (usually limiting it to your outgoing interface's MTU
  minus 40).

  This is used to overcome criminally braindead ISPs or servers which
  block ICMP Fragmentation Needed packets.  The symptoms of this
  problem are that everything works fine from your Linux
  firewall/router, but machines behind it can never exchange large
  packets:
	1) Web browsers connect, then hang with no data received.
	2) Small mail works fine, but large emails hang.
	3) ssh works fine, but scp hangs after initial handshaking.

  Workaround: activate this option and add a rule to your firewall
  configuration like:

        iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN \
		 -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

Helper match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_HELPER
  Helper matching allows you to match packets in dynamic connections
  tracked by a conntrack-helper, ie. ip_conntrack_ftp

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `Y'.

TCPMSS match support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TCPMSS
  This option adds a `tcpmss' match, which allows you to examine the
  MSS value of TCP SYN packets, which control the maximum packet size
  for that connection.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

ULOG target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_ULOG
  This option adds a `ULOG' target, which allows you to create rules in
  any iptables table. The packet is passed to a userspace logging
  daemon using netlink multicast sockets; unlike the LOG target
  which can only be viewed through syslog.

  The appropriate userspace logging daemon (ulogd) may be obtained from
  <http://www.gnumonks.org/projects/ulogd>

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.

LOG target support
CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_LOG
  This option adds a `LOG' target, which allows you to create rules in
  any iptables table which records the packet header to the syslog.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

ipchains (2.2-style) support
CONFIG_IP_NF_COMPAT_IPCHAINS
  This option places ipchains (with masquerading and redirection
  support) back into the kernel, using the new netfilter
  infrastructure.  It is not recommended for new installations (see
  `Packet filtering').  With this enabled, you should be able to use
  the ipchains tool exactly as in 2.2 kernels.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

ipfwadm (2.0-style) support
CONFIG_IP_NF_COMPAT_IPFWADM
  This option places ipfwadm (with masquerading and redirection
  support) back into the kernel, using the new netfilter
  infrastructure.  It is not recommended for new installations (see
  `Packet filtering').  With this enabled, you should be able to use
  the ipfwadm tool exactly as in 2.0 kernels.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

EUI64 address check (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_IP6_NF_MATCH_EUI64
  This module performs checking on the IPv6 source address
  Compares the last 64 bits with the EUI64 (delivered
  from the MAC address) address

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.

MAC address match support
CONFIG_IP6_NF_MATCH_MAC
  mac matching allows you to match packets based on the source
  Ethernet address of the packet.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

length match support
CONFIG_IP6_NF_MATCH_LENGTH
  This option allows you to match the length of a packet against a
  specific value or range of values.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.

Netfilter MARK match support
CONFIG_IP6_NF_MATCH_MARK
  Netfilter mark matching allows you to match packets based on the
  `nfmark' value in the packet.  This can be set by the MARK target
  (see below).

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

Multiple port match support
CONFIG_IP6_NF_MATCH_MULTIPORT
  Multiport matching allows you to match TCP or UDP packets based on
  a series of source or destination ports: normally a rule can only
  match a single range of ports.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

IPV6 queue handler (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_IP6_NF_QUEUE

  This option adds a queue handler to the kernel for IPv6
  packets which lets us to receive the filtered packets
  with QUEUE target using libiptc as we can do with
  the IPv4 now.

Owner match support
CONFIG_IP6_NF_MATCH_OWNER
  Packet owner matching allows you to match locally-generated packets
  based on who created them: the user, group, process or session.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

Packet filtering
CONFIG_IP6_NF_FILTER
  Packet filtering defines a table `filter', which has a series of
  rules for simple packet filtering at local input, forwarding and
  local output.  See the man page for iptables(8).

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

Packet mangling
CONFIG_IP6_NF_MANGLE
  This option adds a `mangle' table to iptables: see the man page for
  iptables(8).  This table is used for various packet alterations
  which can effect how the packet is routed.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

MARK target support
CONFIG_IP6_NF_TARGET_MARK
  This option adds a `MARK' target, which allows you to create rules
  in the `mangle' table which alter the netfilter mark (nfmark) field
  associated with the packet packet prior to routing. This can change
  the routing method (see `Use netfilter MARK value as routing
  key') and can also be used by other subsystems to change their
  behaviour.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

TCP Explicit Congestion Notification support
CONFIG_INET_ECN
  Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) allows routers to notify
  clients about network congestion, resulting in fewer dropped packets
  and increased network performance.  This option adds ECN support to
  the Linux kernel, as well as a sysctl (/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn)
  which allows ECN support to be disabled at runtime.

  Note that, on the Internet, there are many broken firewalls which
  refuse connections from ECN-enabled machines, and it may be a while
  before these firewalls are fixed.  Until then, to access a site
  behind such a firewall (some of which are major sites, at the time
  of this writing) you will have to disable this option, either by
  saying N now or by using the sysctl.

  If in doubt, say N.

IPv6 tables support (required for filtering/masq/NAT)
CONFIG_IP6_NF_IPTABLES
  ip6tables is a general, extensible packet identification framework.
  Currently only the packet filtering and packet mangling subsystem
  for IPv6 use this, but connection tracking is going to follow.
  Say 'Y' or 'M' here if you want to use either of those.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

IPv6 limit match support
CONFIG_IP6_NF_MATCH_LIMIT
  limit matching allows you to control the rate at which a rule can be
  matched: mainly useful in combination with the LOG target ("LOG
  target support", below) and to avoid some Denial of Service attacks.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

LOG target support
CONFIG_IP6_NF_TARGET_LOG
  This option adds a `LOG' target, which allows you to create rules in
  any iptables table which records the packet header to the syslog.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

SYN flood protection
CONFIG_SYN_COOKIES
  Normal TCP/IP networking is open to an attack known as "SYN
  flooding". This denial-of-service attack prevents legitimate remote
  users from being able to connect to your computer during an ongoing
  attack and requires very little work from the attacker, who can
  operate from anywhere on the Internet.

  SYN cookies provide protection against this type of attack. If you
  say Y here, the TCP/IP stack will use a cryptographic challenge
  protocol known as "SYN cookies" to enable legitimate users to
  continue to connect, even when your machine is under attack. There
  is no need for the legitimate users to change their TCP/IP software;
  SYN cookies work transparently to them. For technical information
  about SYN cookies, check out <http://cr.yp.to/syncookies.html>.

  If you are SYN flooded, the source address reported by the kernel is
  likely to have been forged by the attacker; it is only reported as
  an aid in tracing the packets to their actual source and should not
  be taken as absolute truth.

  SYN cookies may prevent correct error reporting on clients when the
  server is really overloaded. If this happens frequently better turn
  them off.

  If you say Y here, note that SYN cookies aren't enabled by default;
  you can enable them by saying Y to "/proc file system support" and
  "Sysctl support" below and executing the command

    echo 1 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies

  at boot time after the /proc file system has been mounted.

  If unsure, say N.

CONFIG_ALPHA_EB66P
  Later variant of the EB66 board.

Eiger
CONFIG_ALPHA_EIGER
  Apparently an obscure OEM single-board computer based on the
  Typhoon/Tsunami chipset family. Information on it is scanty.

Jensen
CONFIG_ALPHA_JENSEN
  DEC PC 150 AXP (aka Jensen): This is a very old Digital system - one
  of the first-generation Alpha systems. A number of these systems
  seem to be available on the second- hand market. The Jensen is a
  floor-standing tower system which originally used a 150MHz 21064 It
  used programmable logic to interface a 486 EISA I/O bridge to the
  CPU.

Ruffian
CONFIG_ALPHA_RUFFIAN
  Samsung APC164UX.  There is a page on known problems and workarounds
  at <http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/FAQ-11.html>.

Sable
CONFIG_ALPHA_SABLE
  Digital AlphaServer 2000 and 2100-based systems.

Takara
CONFIG_ALPHA_TAKARA
  Alpha 11164-based OEM single-board computer.

Wildfire
CONFIG_ALPHA_WILDFIRE
  AlphaServer GS 40/80/160/320 SMP based on the EV67 core.

EV5 CPU daughtercard (model 5/xxx)
CONFIG_ALPHA_PRIMO
  Say Y if you have an AS 1000 5/xxx or an AS 1000A 5/xxx.

EV5 CPU(s) (model 5/xxx)
CONFIG_ALPHA_GAMMA
  Say Y if you have an AS 2000 5/xxx or an AS 2100 5/xxx.

EV67 (or later) CPU (speed > 600MHz)?
CONFIG_ALPHA_EV67
  Is this a machine based on the EV67 core?  If in doubt, select N here
  and the machine will be treated as an EV6.

Use SRM as bootloader
CONFIG_ALPHA_SRM
  There are two different types of booting firmware on Alphas: SRM,
  which is command line driven, and ARC, which uses menus and arrow
  keys. Details about the Linux/Alpha booting process are contained in
  the Linux/Alpha FAQ, accessible on the WWW from
  <http://www.alphalinux.org/>.

  The usual way to load Linux on an Alpha machine is to use MILO
  (a bootloader that lets you pass command line parameters to the
  kernel just like lilo does for the x86 architecture) which can be
  loaded either from ARC or can be installed directly as a permanent
  firmware replacement from floppy (which requires changing a certain
  jumper on the motherboard). If you want to do either of these, say N
  here. If MILO doesn't work on your system (true for Jensen
  motherboards), you can bypass it altogether and boot Linux directly
  from an SRM console; say Y here in order to do that. Note that you
  won't be able to boot from an IDE disk using SRM.

  If unsure, say N.

Legacy kernel start address
CONFIG_ALPHA_LEGACY_START_ADDRESS
  The 2.4 kernel changed the kernel start address from 0x310000
  to 0x810000 to make room for the Wildfire's larger SRM console.

  If you're using aboot 0.7 or later, the bootloader will examine the
  ELF headers to determine where to transfer control. Unfortunately,
  most older bootloaders -- APB or MILO -- hardcoded the kernel start
  address rather than examining the ELF headers, and the result is a
  hard lockup.

  Say Y if you have a broken bootloader.  Say N if you do not, or if
  you wish to run on Wildfire.

Large VMALLOC support
CONFIG_ALPHA_LARGE_VMALLOC
  Process creation and other aspects of virtual memory management can
  be streamlined if we restrict the kernel to one PGD for all vmalloc
  allocations.  This equates to about 8GB.

  Under normal circumstances, this is so far and above what is needed
  as to be laughable.  However, there are certain applications (such
  as benchmark-grade in-kernel web serving) that can make use of as
  much vmalloc space as is available.

  Say N unless you know you need gobs and gobs of vmalloc space.

Non-standard serial port support
CONFIG_SERIAL_NONSTANDARD
  Say Y here if you have any non-standard serial boards -- boards
  which aren't supported using the standard "dumb" serial driver.
  This includes intelligent serial boards such as Cyclades,
  Digiboards, etc. These are usually used for systems that need many
  serial ports because they serve many terminals or dial-in
  connections.

  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
  the questions about non-standard serial boards.

  Most people can say N here.

Extended dumb serial driver options
CONFIG_SERIAL_EXTENDED
  If you wish to use any non-standard features of the standard "dumb"
  driver, say Y here. This includes HUB6 support, shared serial
  interrupts, special multiport support, support for more than the
  four COM 1/2/3/4 boards, etc.

  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
  the questions about serial driver options. If unsure, say N.

Support more than 4 serial ports
CONFIG_SERIAL_MANY_PORTS
  Say Y here if you have dumb serial boards other than the four
  standard COM 1/2/3/4 ports. This may happen if you have an AST
  FourPort, Accent Async, Boca (read the Boca mini-HOWTO, available
  from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>), or other custom
  serial port hardware which acts similar to standard serial port
  hardware. If you only use the standard COM 1/2/3/4 ports, you can
  say N here to save some memory. You can also say Y if you have an
  "intelligent" multiport card such as Cyclades, Digiboards, etc.

Support for sharing serial interrupts
CONFIG_SERIAL_SHARE_IRQ
  Some serial boards have hardware support which allows multiple dumb
  serial ports on the same board to share a single IRQ. To enable
  support for this in the serial driver, say Y here.

Auto-detect IRQ on standard ports (unsafe)
CONFIG_SERIAL_DETECT_IRQ
  Say Y here if you want the kernel to try to guess which IRQ
  to use for your serial port.

  This is considered unsafe; it is far better to configure the IRQ in
  a boot script using the setserial command.

  If unsure, say N.

Support special multiport boards
CONFIG_SERIAL_MULTIPORT
  Some multiport serial ports have special ports which are used to
  signal when there are any serial ports on the board which need
  servicing. Say Y here to enable the serial driver to take advantage
  of those special I/O ports.

SGI IP22 Zilog85C30 serial support
CONFIG_IP22_SERIAL
  If you want to use your IP22's built-in serial ports under Linux,
  answer Y.

SGI Newport Graphics support
CONFIG_SGI_NEWPORT_GFX
  If you have an SGI machine and you want to compile the graphics
  drivers, say Y here. This will include the code for the
  /dev/graphics and /dev/gfx drivers into the kernel for supporting
  virtualized access to your graphics hardware.

SGI Newport Console support
CONFIG_SGI_NEWPORT_CONSOLE
  Say Y here if you want the console on the Newport aka XL graphics
  card of your Indy.  Most people say Y here.

SGI DS1286 RTC support
CONFIG_SGI_DS1286
  If you say Y here and create a character special file /dev/rtc with
  major number 10 and minor number 135 using mknod ("man mknod"), you
  will get access to the real time clock built into your computer.
  Every SGI has such a clock built in. It reports status information
  via the file /proc/rtc and its behaviour is set by various ioctls on
  /dev/rtc.

Indy/I2 Hardware Watchdog
CONFIG_INDYDOG
  Hardwaredriver for the Indy's/I2's watchdog. This is a
  watchdog timer that will reboot the machine after a 60 second 
  timer expired and no process has written to /dev/watchdog during
  that time.

Support the Bell Technologies HUB6 card
CONFIG_HUB6
  Say Y here to enable support in the dumb serial driver to support
  the HUB6 card.

PCMCIA serial device support
CONFIG_PCMCIA_SERIAL_CS
  Say Y here to enable support for 16-bit PCMCIA serial devices,
  including serial port cards, modems, and the modem functions of
  multi-function Ethernet/modem cards. (PCMCIA- or PC-cards are
  credit-card size devices often used with laptops.)

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called serial_cs.o.  If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
  If unsure, say N.

CONFIG_SYNCLINK_CS
  Enable support for the SyncLink PC Card serial adapter, running
  asynchronous and HDLC communications up to 512Kbps. The port is
  selectable for RS-232, V.35, RS-449, RS-530, and X.21

  This driver may be built as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called synclinkmp.o.  If you want to do that, say M
  here.

ACP Modem (Mwave) support
CONFIG_MWAVE
  The ACP modem (Mwave) for Linux is a WinModem. It is composed of a
  kernel driver and a user level application. Together these components
  support direct attachment to public switched telephone networks (PSTNs)
  and support selected world wide countries.

  This version of the ACP Modem driver supports the IBM Thinkpad 600E,
  600, and 770 that include on board ACP modem hardware.

  The modem also supports the standard communications port interface
  (ttySx) and is compatible with the Hayes AT Command Set.

  The user level application needed to use this driver can be found at
  the IBM Linux Technology Center (LTC) web site:
  <http://www.ibm.com/linux/ltc/>.

  If you own one of the above IBM Thinkpads which has the Mwave chipset
  in it, say Y.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called mwave.o. If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt.

/dev/agpgart (AGP Support)
CONFIG_AGP
  AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port) is a bus system mainly used to
  connect graphics cards to the rest of the system.

  If you have an AGP system and you say Y here, it will be possible to
  use the AGP features of your 3D rendering video card. This code acts
  as a sort of "AGP driver" for the motherboard's chipset.

  If you need more texture memory than you can get with the AGP GART
  (theoretically up to 256 MB, but in practice usually 64 or 128 MB
  due to kernel allocation issues), you could use PCI accesses
  and have up to a couple gigs of texture space.

  Note that this is the only means to have XFree4/GLX use
  write-combining with MTRR support on the AGP bus. Without it, OpenGL
  direct rendering will be a lot slower but still faster than PIO.

  You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to
  use GLX or DRI.  If unsure, say N.

  This driver is available as a module.  If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The
  module will be called agpgart.o.

Intel 440LX/BX/GX/815/820/830/840/845/850/860 support
CONFIG_AGP_INTEL
  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of the
  XFree86 4.x on Intel 440LX/BX/GX, 815, 820, 830, 840, 845, 850 and 860 chipsets.

  You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to
  use GLX or DRI.  If unsure, say N.

Intel 460GX support
CONFIG_AGP_I460
  This option gives you AGP support for the Intel 460GX chipset.  This
  chipset, the first to support Intel Itanium processors, is new and
  this option is correspondingly a little experimental.

  If you don't have a 460GX based machine (such as BigSur) with an AGP 
  slot then this option isn't going to do you much good.  If you're
  dying to do Direct Rendering on IA-64, this is what you're looking for.

Intel I810/I815 DC100/I810e support
CONFIG_AGP_I810
  This option gives you AGP support for the Xserver on the Intel 810
  815 and 830m chipset boards for their on-board integrated graphics. This
  is required to do any useful video modes with these boards.

VIA chipset support
CONFIG_AGP_VIA
  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of the
  XFree86 4.x on VIA MPV3/Apollo Pro chipsets.

  You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to
  use GLX or DRI.  If unsure, say N.

AMD Irongate, 761, and 762 support
CONFIG_AGP_AMD
  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of the
  XFree86 4.x on AMD Irongate, 761, and 762 chipsets.

  You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to
  use GLX or DRI.  If unsure, say N.

Generic SiS support
CONFIG_AGP_SIS
  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of the "soon
  to be released" XFree86 4.x on Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS]
  chipsets.

  Note that 5591/5592 AGP chipsets are NOT supported.

  You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to
  use GLX or DRI.  If unsure, say N.

Serverworks LE/HE support
CONFIG_AGP_SWORKS
  Say Y here to support the Serverworks AGP card.  See 
  <http://www.serverworks.com/> for product descriptions and images.

ALI chipset support
CONFIG_AGP_ALI
  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of the
  XFree86 4.x on the following ALi chipsets.  The supported chipsets
  include M1541, M1621, M1631, M1632, M1641,M1647,and M1651.
  For the ALi-chipset question, ALi suggests you refer to
  <http://www.ali.com.tw/eng/support/index.shtml>.

  The M1541 chipset can do AGP 1x and 2x, but note that there is an
  acknowledged incompatibility with Matrox G200 cards. Due to
  timing issues, this chipset cannot do AGP 2x with the G200.
  This is a hardware limitation. AGP 1x seems to be fine, though.

  You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to
  use GLX or DRI.  If unsure, say N.

CONFIG_AGP_HP_ZX1
  This option gives you AGP GART support for the HP ZX1 chipset
  for IA64 processors.

Support for ISA-bus hardware
CONFIG_ISA
  Find out whether you have ISA slots on your motherboard.  ISA is the
  name of a bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff
  inside your box.  Other bus systems are PCI, EISA, MicroChannel
  (MCA) or VESA.  ISA is an older system, now being displaced by PCI;
  newer boards don't support it.  If you have ISA, say Y, otherwise N.

Support for PCI bus hardware
CONFIG_PCI
  Find out whether you have a PCI motherboard. PCI is the name of a
  bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff inside
  your box. Other bus systems are ISA, EISA, MicroChannel (MCA) or
  VESA. If you have PCI, say Y, otherwise N.

  The PCI-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, contains valuable
  information about which PCI hardware does work under Linux and which
  doesn't.

PCI support
CONFIG_PCI_INTEGRATOR
  Find out whether you have a PCI motherboard. PCI is the name of a
  bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff inside
  your box. Other bus systems are ISA, EISA, MicroChannel (MCA) or
  VESA. If you have PCI, say Y, otherwise N.

  The PCI-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, contains valuable
  information about which PCI hardware does work under Linux and which
  doesn't.

QSpan PCI
CONFIG_PCI_QSPAN
  Find out whether you have a PCI motherboard. PCI is the name of a
  bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff inside
  your box. Other bus systems are ISA, EISA, MicroChannel (MCA) or
  VESA. If you have PCI, say Y, otherwise N.

  The PCI-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, contains valuable
  information about which PCI hardware does work under Linux and which
  doesn't.

# Choice: pci_access
PCI access mode
CONFIG_PCI_GOBIOS
  On PCI systems, the BIOS can be used to detect the PCI devices and
  determine their configuration. However, some old PCI motherboards
  have BIOS bugs and may crash if this is done. Also, some embedded
  PCI-based systems don't have any BIOS at all. Linux can also try to
  detect the PCI hardware directly without using the BIOS.

  With this option, you can specify how Linux should detect the PCI
  devices. If you choose "BIOS", the BIOS will be used, if you choose
  "Direct", the BIOS won't be used, and if you choose "Any", the
  kernel will try the direct access method and falls back to the BIOS
  if that doesn't work. If unsure, go with the default, which is
  "Any".

PCI device name database
CONFIG_PCI_NAMES
  By default, the kernel contains a database of all known PCI device
  names to make the information in /proc/pci, /proc/ioports and
  similar files comprehensible to the user. This database increases
  size of the kernel image by about 80KB, but it gets freed after the
  system boots up, so it doesn't take up kernel memory. Anyway, if you
  are building an installation floppy or kernel for an embedded system
  where kernel image size really matters, you can disable this feature
  and you'll get device ID numbers instead of names.

  When in doubt, say Y.

Generic PCI hotplug support
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI
  Say Y here if you have a motherboard with a PCI Hotplug controller.
  This allows you to add and remove PCI cards while the machine is
  powered up and running.  The file system pcihpfs must be mounted
  in order to interact with any PCI Hotplug controllers.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called pci_hotplug.o. If you want to compile it
  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  When in doubt, say N.

Compaq PCI Hotplug driver
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_COMPAQ
  Say Y here if you have a motherboard with a Compaq PCI Hotplug
  controller.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called cpqphp.o. If you want to compile it
  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  When in doubt, say N.

PCI Compaq Hotplug controller NVRAM support
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_COMPAQ_NVRAM
  Say Y here if you have a Compaq server that has a PCI Hotplug
  controller.  This will allow the PCI Hotplug driver to store the PCI
  system configuration options in NVRAM.

  When in doubt, say N.

ACPI PCI Hotplug driver
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_ACPI
  Say Y here if you have a system that supports PCI Hotplug using
  ACPI.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called acpiphp.o. If you want to compile it
  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

MCA support
CONFIG_MCA
  MicroChannel Architecture is found in some IBM PS/2 machines and
  laptops.  It is a bus system similar to PCI or ISA. See
  <file:Documentation/mca.txt> (and especially the web page given
  there) before attempting to build an MCA bus kernel.

Support for EISA-bus hardware
CONFIG_EISA
  The Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) bus was
  developed as an open alternative to the IBM MicroChannel bus.

  The EISA bus provided some of the features of the IBM MicroChannel
  bus while maintaining backward compatibility with cards made for
  the older ISA bus.  The EISA bus saw limited use between 1988 and
  1995 when it was made obsolete by the PCI bus.

  Say Y here if you are building a kernel for an EISA-based machine.

  Otherwise, say N.

SGI Visual Workstation support
CONFIG_VISWS
  The SGI Visual Workstation series is an IA32-based workstation
  based on SGI systems chips with some legacy PC hardware attached.
  Say Y here to create a kernel to run on the SGI 320 or 540.
  A kernel compiled for the Visual Workstation will not run on other
  PC boards and vice versa.
  See <file:Documentation/sgi-visws.txt> for more.

SGI Visual Workstation framebuffer support
CONFIG_FB_SGIVW
  SGI Visual Workstation support for framebuffer graphics.

I2O support
CONFIG_I2O
  The Intelligent Input/Output (I2O) architecture allows hardware
  drivers to be split into two parts: an operating system specific
  module called the OSM and an hardware specific module called the
  HDM. The OSM can talk to a whole range of HDM's, and ideally the
  HDM's are not OS dependent. This allows for the same HDM driver to
  be used under different operating systems if the relevant OSM is in
  place. In order for this to work, you need to have an I2O interface
  adapter card in your computer. This card contains a special I/O
  processor (IOP), thus allowing high speeds since the CPU does not
  have to deal with I/O.

  If you say Y here, you will get a choice of interface adapter
  drivers and OSM's with the following questions.

  This support is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  You will get modules called
  i2o_core.o and i2o_config.o.

  If unsure, say N.

I2O PCI support
CONFIG_I2O_PCI
  Say Y for support of PCI bus I2O interface adapters. Currently this
  is the only variety supported, so you should say Y.

  This support is also available as a module called i2o_pci.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

I2O Block OSM
CONFIG_I2O_BLOCK
  Include support for the I2O Block OSM. The Block OSM presents disk
  and other structured block devices to the operating system.

  This support is also available as a module called i2o_block.o ( =
  code which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

I2O LAN OSM
CONFIG_I2O_LAN
  Include support for the LAN OSM. You will also need to include
  support for token ring or FDDI if you wish to use token ring or FDDI
  I2O cards with this driver.

  This support is also available as a module called i2o_lan.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

I2O SCSI OSM
CONFIG_I2O_SCSI
  Allows direct SCSI access to SCSI devices on a SCSI or FibreChannel
  I2O controller. You can use both the SCSI and Block OSM together if
  you wish.

  This support is also available as a module called i2o_scsi.o ( =
  code which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

I2O /proc support
CONFIG_I2O_PROC
  If you say Y here and to "/proc file system support", you will be
  able to read I2O related information from the virtual directory
  /proc/i2o.

  This support is also available as a module called i2o_proc.o ( =
  code which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Plug and Play support
CONFIG_PNP
  Plug and Play (PnP) is a standard for peripherals which allows those
  peripherals to be configured by software, e.g. assign IRQ's or other
  parameters. No jumpers on the cards are needed, instead the values
  are provided to the cards from the BIOS, from the operating system,
  or using a user-space utility.

  Say Y here if you would like Linux to configure your Plug and Play
  devices. You should then also say Y to "ISA Plug and Play support",
  below. Alternatively, you can say N here and configure your PnP
  devices using the user space utilities contained in the isapnptools
  package.

  This support is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

ISA Plug and Play support
CONFIG_ISAPNP
  Say Y here if you would like support for ISA Plug and Play devices.
  Some information is in <file:Documentation/isapnp.txt>.

  This support is also available as a module called isapnp.o ( =
  code which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If unsure, say Y.

PNPBIOS support
CONFIG_PNPBIOS
  Linux uses the PNPBIOS as defined in "Plug and Play BIOS
  Specification Version 1.0A May 5, 1994" to autodetect built-in
  mainboard resources (e.g. parallel port resources).

  Other features (e.g. change resources, ESCD, event notification,
  Docking station information, ISAPNP services) are not used.

  Note: ACPI is expected to supersede PNPBIOS some day, currently it
  co-exists nicely.

  See latest pcmcia-cs (stand-alone package) for a nice "lspnp" tools,
  or have a look at /proc/bus/pnp.

  If unsure, say Y.

Support for hot-pluggable devices
CONFIG_HOTPLUG
  Say Y here if you want to plug devices into your computer while
  the system is running, and be able to use them quickly.  In many
  cases, the devices can likewise be unplugged at any time too.

  One well known example of this is PCMCIA- or PC-cards, credit-card
  size devices such as network cards, modems or hard drives which are
  plugged into slots found on all modern laptop computers.  Another
  example, used on modern desktops as well as laptops, is USB.

  Enable HOTPLUG and KMOD, and build a modular kernel.  Get agent
  software (at <http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/>) and install it.
  Then your kernel will automatically call out to a user mode "policy
  agent" (/sbin/hotplug) to load modules and set up software needed
  to use devices as you hotplug them.

PCMCIA/CardBus support
CONFIG_PCMCIA
  Say Y here if you want to attach PCMCIA- or PC-cards to your Linux
  computer.  These are credit-card size devices such as network cards,
  modems or hard drives often used with laptops computers.  There are
  actually two varieties of these cards: the older 16 bit PCMCIA cards
  and the newer 32 bit CardBus cards.  If you want to use CardBus
  cards, you need to say Y here and also to "CardBus support" below.

  To use your PC-cards, you will need supporting software from David
  Hinds' pcmcia-cs package (see the file <file:Documentation/Changes>
  for location).  Please also read the PCMCIA-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  When compiled this way, there will be modules called pcmcia_core.o
  and ds.o.  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and
  read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

CardBus card and (Yenta) bridge support
CONFIG_CARDBUS
  CardBus is a bus mastering architecture for PC-cards, which allows
  for 32 bit PC-cards (the original PCMCIA standard specifies only
  a 16 bit wide bus). Many newer PC-cards are actually CardBus cards.

  This option enables support for CardBus PC Cards, as well as support
  for CardBus host bridges.  Virtually all modern PCMCIA bridges are
  CardBus compatible.  A "bridge" is the hardware inside your computer
  that PCMCIA cards are plugged into.

  To use your PC-cards, you will need supporting software from David
  Hinds' pcmcia-cs package (see the file <file:Documentation/Changes>
  for location).

  If unsure, say Y.

i82092 compatible bridge support
CONFIG_I82092
  This provides support for the Intel I82092AA PCI-to-PCMCIA bridge device,
  found in some older laptops and more commonly in evaluation boards for the
  chip.

i82365 compatible host bridge support
CONFIG_I82365
  Say Y here to include support for ISA-bus PCMCIA host bridges that
  are register compatible with the Intel i82365.  These are found on
  older laptops and ISA-bus card readers for desktop systems.  A
  "bridge" is the hardware inside your computer that PCMCIA cards are
  plugged into. If unsure, say N.

Databook TCIC host bridge support
CONFIG_TCIC
  Say Y here to include support for the Databook TCIC family of PCMCIA
  host bridges. These are only found on a handful of old systems.
  "Bridge" is the name used for the hardware inside your computer that
  PCMCIA cards are plugged into. If unsure, say N.

System V IPC
CONFIG_SYSVIPC
  Inter Process Communication is a suite of library functions and
  system calls which let processes (running programs) synchronize and
  exchange information. It is generally considered to be a good thing,
  and some programs won't run unless you say Y here. In particular, if
  you want to run the DOS emulator dosemu under Linux (read the
  DOSEMU-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>), you'll need to say Y
  here.

  You can find documentation about IPC with "info ipc" and also in
  section 6.4 of the Linux Programmer's Guide, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#guide>.

BSD Process Accounting
CONFIG_BSD_PROCESS_ACCT
  If you say Y here, a user level program will be able to instruct the
  kernel (via a special system call) to write process accounting
  information to a file: whenever a process exits, information about
  that process will be appended to the file by the kernel.  The
  information includes things such as creation time, owning user,
  command name, memory usage, controlling terminal etc. (the complete
  list is in the struct acct in <file:include/linux/acct.h>).  It is
  up to the user level program to do useful things with this
  information.  This is generally a good idea, so say Y.

Sysctl support
CONFIG_SYSCTL
  The sysctl interface provides a means of dynamically changing
  certain kernel parameters and variables on the fly without requiring
  a recompile of the kernel or reboot of the system.  The primary
  interface consists of a system call, but if you say Y to "/proc
  file system support", a tree of modifiable sysctl entries will be
  generated beneath the /proc/sys directory. They are explained in the
  files in <file:Documentation/sysctl/>.  Note that enabling this
  option will enlarge the kernel by at least 8 KB.

  As it is generally a good thing, you should say Y here unless
  building a kernel for install/rescue disks or your system is very
  limited in memory.

# Choice: kcore
Kernel core (/proc/kcore) format
CONFIG_KCORE_ELF
  If you enabled support for /proc file system then the file
  /proc/kcore will contain the kernel core image. This can be used
  in gdb:

  $ cd /usr/src/linux ; gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore

  You have two choices here: ELF and A.OUT. Selecting ELF will make
  /proc/kcore appear in ELF core format as defined by the Executable
  and Linking Format specification. Selecting A.OUT will choose the
  old "a.out" format which may be necessary for some old versions
  of binutils or on some architectures.

  This is especially useful if you have compiled the kernel with the
  "-g" option to preserve debugging information. It is mainly used
  for examining kernel data structures on the live kernel so if you
  don't understand what this means or are not a kernel hacker, just
  leave it at its default value ELF.

Select a.out format for /proc/kcore
CONFIG_KCORE_AOUT
  Not necessary unless you're using a very out-of-date binutils
  version.  You probably want KCORE_ELF.

Kernel support for ELF binaries
CONFIG_BINFMT_ELF
  ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) is a format for libraries and
  executables used across different architectures and operating
  systems. Saying Y here will enable your kernel to run ELF binaries
  and enlarge it by about 13 KB. ELF support under Linux has now all
  but replaced the traditional Linux a.out formats (QMAGIC and ZMAGIC)
  because it is portable (this does *not* mean that you will be able
  to run executables from different architectures or operating systems
  however) and makes building run-time libraries very easy. Many new
  executables are distributed solely in ELF format. You definitely
  want to say Y here.

  Information about ELF is contained in the ELF HOWTO available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  If you find that after upgrading from Linux kernel 1.2 and saying Y
  here, you still can't run any ELF binaries (they just crash), then
  you'll have to install the newest ELF runtime libraries, including
  ld.so (check the file <file:Documentation/Changes> for location and
  latest version).

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called binfmt_elf.o. Saying M or N here is dangerous because
  some crucial programs on your system might be in ELF format.

Kernel support for a.out binaries
CONFIG_BINFMT_AOUT
  A.out (Assembler.OUTput) is a set of formats for libraries and
  executables used in the earliest versions of UNIX. Linux used the
  a.out formats QMAGIC and ZMAGIC until they were replaced with the
  ELF format.

  As more and more programs are converted to ELF, the use for a.out
  will gradually diminish. If you disable this option it will reduce
  your kernel by one page. This is not much and by itself does not
  warrant removing support. However its removal is a good idea if you
  wish to ensure that absolutely none of your programs will use this
  older executable format. If you don't know what to answer at this
  point then answer Y. If someone told you "You need a kernel with
  QMAGIC support" then you'll have to say Y here. You may answer M to
  compile a.out support as a module and later load the module when you
  want to use a program or library in a.out format. The module will be
  called binfmt_aout.o. Saying M or N here is dangerous though,
  because some crucial programs on your system might still be in A.OUT
  format.

OSF/1 v4 readv/writev compatibility
CONFIG_OSF4_COMPAT
  Say Y if you are using OSF/1 binaries (like Netscape and Acrobat)
  with v4 shared libraries freely available from Compaq. If you're
  going to use shared libraries from Tru64 version 5.0 or later, say N.

Kernel support for Linux/Intel ELF binaries
CONFIG_BINFMT_EM86
  Say Y here if you want to be able to execute Linux/Intel ELF
  binaries just like native Alpha binaries on your Alpha machine. For
  this to work, you need to have the emulator /usr/bin/em86 in place.

  You can get the same functionality by saying N here and saying Y to
  "Kernel support for MISC binaries".

  You may answer M to compile the emulation support as a module and
  later load the module when you want to use a Linux/Intel binary. The
  module will be called binfmt_em86.o. If unsure, say Y.

Kernel support for SOM binaries
CONFIG_BINFMT_SOM
  SOM is a binary executable format inherited from HP/UX.  Say Y here
  to be able to load and execute SOM binaries directly.

Kernel support for MISC binaries
CONFIG_BINFMT_MISC
  If you say Y here, it will be possible to plug wrapper-driven binary
  formats into the kernel. You will like this especially when you use
  programs that need an interpreter to run like Java, Python or
  Emacs-Lisp. It's also useful if you often run DOS executables under
  the Linux DOS emulator DOSEMU (read the DOSEMU-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>). Once you have
  registered such a binary class with the kernel, you can start one of
  those programs simply by typing in its name at a shell prompt; Linux
  will automatically feed it to the correct interpreter.

  You can do other nice things, too. Read the file
  <file:Documentation/binfmt_misc.txt> to learn how to use this
  feature, and <file:Documentation/java.txt> for information about how
  to include Java support.

  You must say Y to "/proc file system support" (CONFIG_PROC_FS) to
  use this part of the kernel.

  You may say M here for module support and later load the module when
  you have use for it; the module is called binfmt_misc.o. If you
  don't know what to answer at this point, say Y.

Kernel support for JAVA binaries
CONFIG_BINFMT_JAVA
  If you say Y here, the kernel will load and execute Java J-code
  binaries directly.  Note: this option is obsolete and scheduled for
  removal, use CONFIG_BINFMT_MISC instead.

Solaris binary emulation
CONFIG_SOLARIS_EMUL
  This is experimental code which will enable you to run (many)
  Solaris binaries on your SPARC Linux machine.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called solaris.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

SUN SME environment monitoring
CONFIG_ENVCTRL
  Kernel support for temperature and fan monitoring on Sun SME
  machines.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called envctrl.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

# Choice: x86type
Processor family
CONFIG_M386
  This is the processor type of your CPU. This information is used for
  optimizing purposes. In order to compile a kernel that can run on
  all x86 CPU types (albeit not optimally fast), you can specify
  "386" here.

  The kernel will not necessarily run on earlier architectures than
  the one you have chosen, e.g. a Pentium optimized kernel will run on
  a PPro, but not necessarily on a i486.

  Here are the settings recommended for greatest speed:
   - "386" for the AMD/Cyrix/Intel 386DX/DXL/SL/SLC/SX, Cyrix/TI
     486DLC/DLC2, UMC 486SX-S and NexGen Nx586.  Only "386" kernels
     will run on a 386 class machine.
   - "486" for the AMD/Cyrix/IBM/Intel 486DX/DX2/DX4 or
     SL/SLC/SLC2/SLC3/SX/SX2 and UMC U5D or U5S.
   - "586" for generic Pentium CPUs, possibly lacking the TSC
     (time stamp counter) register.
   - "Pentium-Classic" for the Intel Pentium.
   - "Pentium-MMX" for the Intel Pentium MMX.
   - "Pentium-Pro" for the Intel Pentium Pro/Celeron/Pentium II.
   - "Pentium-III" for the Intel Pentium III
     and Celerons based on the Coppermine core.
   - "Pentium-4" for the Intel Pentium 4.
   - "K6" for the AMD K6, K6-II and K6-III (aka K6-3D).
   - "Athlon" for the AMD K7 family (Athlon/Duron/Thunderbird).
   - "Elan" for the AMD Elan family (Elan SC400/SC410).
   - "Crusoe" for the Transmeta Crusoe series.
   - "Winchip-C6" for original IDT Winchip.
   - "Winchip-2" for IDT Winchip 2.
   - "Winchip-2A" for IDT Winchips with 3dNow! capabilities.
   - "CyrixIII" for VIA Cyrix III or VIA C3.

  If you don't know what to do, choose "386".

486
CONFIG_M486
  Select this for a x486 processor, ether Intel or one of the
  compatible processors from AMD, Cyrix, IBM, or Intel.  Includes DX,
  DX2, and DX4 variants; also SL/SLC/SLC2/SLC3/SX/SX2 and UMC U5D or
  U5S.

586/K5/5x86/6x86/6x86MX
CONFIG_M586
  Select this for an x586 or x686 processor such as the AMD K5, the
  Intel 5x86 or 6x86, or the Intel 6x86MX.  This choice does not
  assume the RDTSC instruction.

Pentium Classic
CONFIG_M586TSC
  Select this for a Pentium Classic processor with the RDTSC (Read
  Time Stamp Counter) instruction for benchmarking.

32-bit PDC
CONFIG_PDC_NARROW
  Saying Y here will allow developers with a C180, C200, C240, C360,
  J200, J210, and/or a J2240 to test 64-bit kernels by providing a
  wrapper for the 32-bit PDC calls.  Since the machines which require
  this option do not support over 4G of RAM, this option is targeted
  for developers of these machines wishing to test changes on both
  32-bit and 64-bit configurations.

  If unsure, say N.

VGA text console
CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE
  Saying Y here will allow you to use Linux in text mode through a
  display that complies with the generic VGA standard. Virtually
  everyone wants that.

  The program SVGATextMode can be used to utilize SVGA video cards to
  their full potential in text mode. Download it from
  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/console/>.

  Say Y.

Distribute interrupts on all CPUs by default
CONFIG_IRQ_ALL_CPUS
  This option gives the kernel permission to distribute IRQs across
  multiple CPUs.  Saying N here will route all IRQs to the first
  CPU. Generally SMP PowerMacs can answer Y. SMP IBM CHRP boxes or
  Power3 boxes should say N for now.

Video mode selection support
CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT
  This enables support for text mode selection on kernel startup. If
  you want to take advantage of some high-resolution text mode your
  card's BIOS offers, but the traditional Linux utilities like
  SVGATextMode don't, you can say Y here and set the mode using the
  "vga=" option from your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) or set
  "vga=ask" which brings up a video mode menu on kernel startup. (Try
  "man bootparam" or see the documentation of your boot loader about
  how to pass options to the kernel.)

  Read the file <file:Documentation/svga.txt> for more information
  about the Video mode selection support. If unsure, say N.

Support for frame buffer devices
CONFIG_FB
  The frame buffer device provides an abstraction for the graphics
  hardware. It represents the frame buffer of some video hardware and
  allows application software to access the graphics hardware through
  a well-defined interface, so the software doesn't need to know
  anything about the low-level (hardware register) stuff.

  Frame buffer devices work identically across the different
  architectures supported by Linux and make the implementation of
  application programs easier and more portable; at this point, an X
  server exists which uses the frame buffer device exclusively.
  On several non-X86 architectures, the frame buffer device is the
  only way to use the graphics hardware.

  The device is accessed through special device nodes, usually located
  in the /dev directory, i.e. /dev/fb*.

  You need an utility program called fbset to make full use of frame
  buffer devices. Please read <file:Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt>
  and the Framebuffer-HOWTO at
  <http://www.tahallah.demon.co.uk/programming/prog.html> for more
  information.

  Say Y here and to the driver for your graphics board below if you
  are compiling a kernel for a non-x86 architecture.

  If you are compiling for the x86 architecture, you can say Y if you
  want to play with it, but it is not essential. Please note that
  running graphical applications that directly touch the hardware
  (e.g. an accelerated X server) and that are not frame buffer
  device-aware may cause unexpected results. If unsure, say N.

Acorn VIDC support
CONFIG_FB_ACORN
  This is the frame buffer device driver for the Acorn VIDC graphics
  hardware found in Acorn RISC PCs and other ARM-based machines.  If
  unsure, say N.

Permedia2 support
CONFIG_FB_PM2
  This is the frame buffer device driver for the Permedia2 AGP frame
  buffer card from ASK, aka `Graphic Blaster Exxtreme'.  There is a
  product page at
  <http://www.ask.com.hk/product/Permedia%202/permedia2.htm>.

CONFIG_FB_AMIGA
  This is the frame buffer device driver for the builtin graphics
  chipset found in Amigas.

  The driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted and removed from the running kernel whenever you want). The
  module will be called amifb.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Amiga OCS chipset support
CONFIG_FB_AMIGA_OCS
  This enables support for the original Agnus and Denise video chips,
  found in the Amiga 1000 and most A500's and A2000's. If you intend
  to run Linux on any of these systems, say Y; otherwise say N.

Amiga ECS chipset support
CONFIG_FB_AMIGA_ECS
  This enables support for the Enhanced Chip Set, found in later
  A500's, later A2000's, the A600, the A3000, the A3000T and CDTV. If
  you intend to run Linux on any of these systems, say Y; otherwise
  say N.

Amiga AGA chipset support
CONFIG_FB_AMIGA_AGA
  This enables support for the Advanced Graphics Architecture (also
  known as the AGA or AA) Chip Set, found in the A1200, A4000, A4000T
  and CD32. If you intend to run Linux on any of these systems, say Y;
  otherwise say N.

Amiga CyberVision support
CONFIG_FB_CYBER
  This enables support for the Cybervision 64 graphics card from
  Phase5. Please note that its use is not all that intuitive (i.e. if
  you have any questions, be sure to ask!). Say N unless you have a
  Cybervision 64 or plan to get one before you next recompile the
  kernel. Please note that this driver DOES NOT support the
  Cybervision 64 3D card, as they use incompatible video chips.

CyberPro 20x0 support
CONFIG_FB_CYBER2000
  This enables support for the Integraphics CyberPro 20x0 and 5000
  VGA chips used in the Rebel.com Netwinder and other machines.
  Say Y if you have a NetWinder or a graphics card containing this
  device, otherwise say N.

Amiga CyberVision3D support
CONFIG_FB_VIRGE
  This enables support for the Cybervision 64/3D graphics card from
  Phase5. Please note that its use is not all that intuitive (i.e. if
  you have any questions, be sure to ask!). Say N unless you have a
  Cybervision 64/3D or plan to get one before you next recompile the
  kernel. Please note that this driver DOES NOT support the older
  Cybervision 64 card, as they use incompatible video chips.

CONFIG_FB_RETINAZ3
  This enables support for the Retina Z3 graphics card. Say N unless
  you have a Retina Z3 or plan to get one before you next recompile
  the kernel.

  This enables support for Cirrus Logic GD542x/543x based boards on
  Amiga: SD64, Piccolo, Picasso II/II+, Picasso IV, or EGS Spectrum.

  If you have a PCI-based system, this enables support for these
  chips: GD-543x, GD-544x, GD-5480.

  Please read the file <file:Documentation/fb/clgenfb.txt>.

  Say N unless you have such a graphics board or plan to get one
  before you next recompile the kernel.

  This is the frame buffer device driver for generic VESA 2.0
  compliant graphic cards. The older VESA 1.2 cards are not supported.
  You will get a boot time penguin logo at no additional cost. Please
  read <file:Documentation/fb/vesafb.txt>. If unsure, say Y.

VGA 16-color planar support
CONFIG_FBCON_VGA_PLANES
  This low level frame buffer console driver enable the kernel to use
  the 16-color planar modes of the old VGA cards where the bits of
  each pixel are separated into 4 planes.

  Only answer Y here if you have a (very old) VGA card that isn't VESA
  2 compatible.

VGA 16-color graphics console
CONFIG_FB_VGA16
  This is the frame buffer device driver for VGA 16 color graphic
  cards. Say Y if you have such a card.

  This code is also available as a module. If you want to compile it
  as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want), say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  vga16fb.o.

Generic STI frame buffer device support
CONFIG_FB_STI
  STI refers to the HP "Standard Text Interface" which is a set of
  BIOS routines contained in a ROM chip in HP PA-RISC based machines.
  Enabling this option will implement the linux framebuffer device and
  an fbcon color text console using calls to the STI BIOS routines.
  The HP framebuffer device is usually planar, uses a strange memory
  layout, and changing the plane mask to create colored pixels
  requires a call to the STI routines, so do not expect /dev/fb to
  actually be useful.  However, it is the best we have as far as
  graphics on the HP chipsets due to lack of hardware level
  documentation for the various on-board HP chipsets used in these
  systems.  It is sufficient for basic text console functions,
  including fonts.

  You should probably enable this option, unless you are having
  trouble getting video when booting the kernel (make sure it isn't
  just that you are running the console on the serial port, though).
  Really old HP boxes may not have STI, and must use the PDC BIOS
  console or the IODC BIOS.

Select other compiled-in fonts
CONFIG_FBCON_FONTS
  Say Y here if you would like to use fonts other than the default
  your frame buffer console usually use.

  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
  the questions about foreign fonts.

  If unsure, say N (the default choices are safe).

VGA 8x16 font
CONFIG_FONT_8x16
  This is the "high resolution" font for the VGA frame buffer (the one
  provided by the VGA text console 80x25 mode.

  If unsure, say Y.

  Answer Y here will make the kernel provide only the 8x8 fonts (these
  are the less readable).

  If unsure, say N.

Sparc console 8x16 font
CONFIG_FONT_SUN8x16
  This is the high resolution console font for Sun machines. Say Y.

Sparc console 12x22 font (not supported by all drivers)
CONFIG_FONT_SUN12x22
  This is the high resolution console font for Sun machines with very
  big letters (like the letters used in the SPARC PROM). If the
  standard font is unreadable for you, say Y, otherwise say N.

VGA 8x8 font
CONFIG_FONT_8x8
  This is the "high resolution" font for the VGA frame buffer (the one
  provided by the text console 80x50 (and higher) modes).

  Note that this is a poor quality font. The VGA 8x16 font is quite a
  lot more readable.

  Given the resolution provided by the frame buffer device, answer N
  here is safe.

Mac console 6x11 font (not supported by all drivers)
CONFIG_FONT_6x11
  Small console font with Macintosh-style high-half glyphs.  Some Mac
  framebuffer drivers don't support this one at all.

  glyphs.

Backward compatibility mode for Xpmac
CONFIG_FB_COMPAT_XPMAC
  If you use the Xpmac X server (common with mklinux), you'll need to
  say Y here to use X. You should consider changing to XFree86 which
  includes a server that supports the frame buffer device directly
  (XF68_FBDev).

Hercules (HGA) mono graphics support
CONFIG_FB_HGA
  Say Y here if you have a Hercules mono graphics card.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called hgafb.o. If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  As this card technology is 15 years old, most people will answer N
  here.

  discussion.

NEC PowerVR 2 display support
CONFIG_FB_PVR2
  Say Y here if you have a PowerVR 2 card in your box.  If you plan to
  run linux on your Dreamcast, you will have to say Y here.
  This driver may or may not work on other PowerVR 2 cards, but is
  totally untested.  Use at your own risk.  If unsure, say N.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called pvr2fb.o.  If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  You can pass several parameters to the driver at boot time or at
  module load time.  The parameters look like "video=pvr2:XXX", where
  the meaning of XXX can be found at the end of the main source file
  (<file:drivers/video/pvr2fb.c>). Please see the file
  <file:Documentation/fb/pvr2fb.txt>.

Debug pvr2fb
CONFIG_FB_PVR2_DEBUG
  Say Y here if you wish for the pvr2fb driver to print out debugging
  messages. Most people will want to say N here. If unsure, you will
  also want to say N.

  Mystique 220, Productiva G100, Mystique G200, Millennium G200,
  Matrox G400, G450 or G550 card in your box. At this time, support for 
  the G-series digital output is almost non-existant.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called matroxfb.o. If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  You can pass several parameters to the driver at boot time or at
  module load time. The parameters look like "video=matrox:XXX", and
  are described in <file:Documentation/fb/matroxfb.txt>.

Matrox Millennium I/II support
CONFIG_FB_MATROX_MILLENIUM
  Say Y here if you have a Matrox Millennium or Matrox Millennium II
  video card. If you select "Advanced lowlevel driver options" below,
  you should check 4 bpp packed pixel, 8 bpp packed pixel, 16 bpp
  packed pixel, 24 bpp packed pixel and 32 bpp packed pixel. You can
  also use font widths different from 8.

Matrox Mystique support
CONFIG_FB_MATROX_MYSTIQUE
  Say Y here if you have a Matrox Mystique or Matrox Mystique 220
  video card. If you select "Advanced lowlevel driver options" below,
  you should check 8 bpp packed pixel, 16 bpp packed pixel, 24 bpp
  packed pixel and 32 bpp packed pixel. You can also use font widths
  different from 8.

Matrox G100/G200/G400/G450/G550 support
CONFIG_FB_MATROX_G100
  Say Y here if you have a Matrox G100, G200, G400, G450, or G550
  based video card. If you select "Advanced lowlevel driver options",
  you should check 8 bpp packed pixel, 16 bpp packed pixel, 24 bpp
  packed pixel and 32 bpp packed pixel. You can also use font widths
  different from 8.

  If you need support for G400 secondary head, you must first say Y to
  "I2C support" and "I2C bit-banging support" in the character devices
  section, and then to "Matrox I2C support" and "G400 second head
  support" here in the framebuffer section.
  
  If you have G550, you must also compile support for G450/G550 secondary
  head into kernel, otherwise picture will be shown only on the output you
  are probably not using...

  If you need support for G450 or G550 secondary head, say Y to
  "Matrox G450/G550 second head support" below.

Matrox I2C support
CONFIG_FB_MATROX_I2C
  This drivers creates I2C buses which are needed for accessing the
  DDC (I2C) bus present on all Matroxes, an I2C bus which
  interconnects Matrox optional devices, like MGA-TVO on G200 and
  G400, and the secondary head DDC bus, present on G400 only.

  You can say Y or M here if you want to experiment with monitor
  detection code. You must say Y or M here if you want to use either
  second head of G400 or MGA-TVO on G200 or G400.

  If you compile it as module, it will create a module named
  i2c-matroxfb.o.

Matrox G400 second head support
CONFIG_FB_MATROX_MAVEN
  WARNING !!! This support does not work with G450 !!!

  Say Y or M here if you want to use a secondary head (meaning two
  monitors in parallel) on G400 or MGA-TVO add-on on G200. Secondary
  head is not compatible with accelerated XFree 3.3.x SVGA servers -
  secondary head output is blanked while you are in X. With XFree
  3.9.17 preview you can use both heads if you use SVGA over fbdev or
  the fbdev driver on first head and the fbdev driver on second head.

  If you compile it as module, two modules are created,
  matroxfb_crtc2.o and matroxfb_maven.o. Matroxfb_maven is needed for
  both G200 and G400, matroxfb_crtc2 is needed only by G400. You must
  also load i2c-matroxfb to get it to run.

  The driver starts in monitor mode and you must use the matroxset
  tool (available at
  <ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/>) to switch it to
  PAL or NTSC or to swap primary and secondary head outputs.
  Secondary head driver also always start in 640x480 resolution, you
  must use fbset to change it.

  Also do not forget that second head supports only 16 and 32 bpp
  packed pixels, so it is a good idea to compile them into the kernel
  too.  You can use only some font widths, as the driver uses generic
  painting procedures (the secondary head does not use acceleration
  engine).

Matrox G450 second head support
CONFIG_FB_MATROX_G450
  Say Y or M here if you want to use a secondary head (meaning two
  monitors in parallel) on G450, or if you are using analog output
  of G550.

  If you compile it as module, two modules are created,
  matroxfb_crtc2.o and matroxfb_g450.o. Both modules are needed if you
  want two independent display devices.

  The driver starts in monitor mode and currently does not support
  output in TV modes.  You must use the matroxset tool (available
  at <ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/>) to swap
  primary and secondary head outputs.  Secondary head driver always
  start in 640x480 resolution and you must use fbset to change it.

  Note on most G550 cards the analog output is the secondary head,
  so you will need to say Y here to use it.

  Also do not forget that second head supports only 16 and 32 bpp
  packed pixels, so it is a good idea to compile them into the kernel
  too. You can use only some font widths, as the driver uses generic
  painting procedures (the secondary head does not use acceleration
  engine).

Matrox unified driver multihead support
CONFIG_FB_MATROX_MULTIHEAD
  Say Y here if you have more than one (supported) Matrox device in
  your computer and you want to use all of them for different monitors
  ("multihead"). If you have only one device, you should say N because
  the driver compiled with Y is larger and a bit slower, especially on
  ia32 (ix86).

  If you said M to "Matrox unified accelerated driver" and N here, you
  will still be able to use several Matrox devices simultaneously:
  insert several instances of the module matroxfb.o into the kernel
  with insmod, supplying the parameter "dev=N" where N is 0, 1, etc.
  for the different Matrox devices. This method is slightly faster but
  uses 40 KB of kernel memory per Matrox card.

  There is no need for enabling 'Matrox multihead support' if you have
  only one Matrox card in the box.

3Dfx Voodoo Graphics / Voodoo2 frame buffer support
CONFIG_FB_VOODOO1
  Say Y here if you have a 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics (Voodoo1/sst1) or 
  Voodoo2 (cvg) based graphics card.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be 
  inserted and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called sstfb.o. If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt.

  WARNING: Do not use any application that uses the 3D engine
  (namely glide) while using this driver.
  Please read the file Documentation/fb/README-sstfb.txt for supported
  options and other important info  support.

MDA text console (dual-headed)
CONFIG_MDA_CONSOLE
  Say Y here if you have an old MDA or monochrome Hercules graphics
  adapter in your system acting as a second head ( = video card). You
  will then be able to use two monitors with your Linux system. Do not
  say Y here if your MDA card is the primary card in your system; the
  normal VGA driver will handle it.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called mdacon.o. If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If unsure, say N.

  see <http://www.toshiba.com/taec/components/Generic/risc/tx3912.htm>.

  Say Y here to enable kernel support for the on-board framebuffer.

Virtual Frame Buffer support (ONLY FOR TESTING!)
CONFIG_FB_VIRTUAL
  This is a `virtual' frame buffer device. It operates on a chunk of
  unswappable kernel memory instead of on the memory of a graphics
  board. This means you cannot see any output sent to this frame
  buffer device, while it does consume precious memory. The main use
  of this frame buffer device is testing and debugging the frame
  buffer subsystem. Do NOT enable it for normal systems! To protect
  the innocent, it has to be enabled explicitly at boot time using the
  kernel option `video=vfb:'.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted and removed from the running kernel whenever you want). The
  module will be called vfb.o. If you want to compile it as a module,
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  a framebuffer device.  There are both PCI and AGP versions.  You
  don't need to choose this to run the Radeon in plain VGA mode.
  There is a product page at
  <http://www.ati.com/na/pages/products/pc/radeon32/index.html>.

SA-1100 LCD support
CONFIG_FB_SA1100
  This is a framebuffer device for the SA-1100 LCD Controller.
  See <http://www.linux-fbdev.org/> for information on framebuffer
  devices.

  If you plan to use the LCD display with your SA-1100 system, say
  Y here.

Advanced low level driver options
CONFIG_FBCON_ADVANCED
  The frame buffer console uses character drawing routines that are
  tailored to the specific organization of pixels in the memory of
  your graphics hardware. These are called the low level frame buffer
  console drivers. Note that they are used for text console output
  only; they are NOT needed for graphical applications.

  If you say N here, the needed low level drivers are automatically
  enabled, depending on what frame buffer devices you selected above.
  This is recommended for most users.

  If you say Y here, you have more fine-grained control over which low
  level drivers are enabled. You can e.g. leave out low level drivers
  for color depths you do not intend to use for text consoles.

  Low level frame buffer console drivers can be modules ( = code which
  can be inserted and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). The modules will be called fbcon-*.o. If you want to compile
  (some of) them as modules, read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If unsure, say N.

  mode.

Parallel-port support
CONFIG_PARPORT
  If you want to use devices connected to your machine's parallel port
  (the connector at the computer with 25 holes), e.g. printer, ZIP
  drive, PLIP link (Parallel Line Internet Protocol is mainly used to
  create a mini network by connecting the parallel ports of two local
  machines) etc., then you need to say Y here; please read
  <file:Documentation/parport.txt> and
  <file:drivers/parport/BUGS-parport>.

  For extensive information about drivers for many devices attaching
  to the parallel port see <http://www.torque.net/linux-pp.html> on
  the WWW.

  It is possible to share a single parallel port among several devices
  and it is safe to compile all the corresponding drivers into the
  kernel.  If you want to compile parallel port support as a module
  ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the running
  kernel whenever you want), say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  parport.o.  If you have more than one parallel port and want to
  specify which port and IRQ to be used by this driver at module load
  time, take a look at <file:Documentation/parport.txt>.

  If unsure, say Y.

PC-style hardware
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC
  You should say Y here if you have a PC-style parallel port. All IBM
  PC compatible computers and some Alphas have PC-style parallel
  ports.

  This code is also available as a module.  If you want to compile it
  as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want), say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  parport_pc.o.

  If unsure, say Y.

Parallel+serial PCI multi-IO card support
CONFIG_PARPORT_SERIAL
  This adds support for multi-IO PCI cards that have parallel and
  serial ports.  You should say Y or M here.  If you say M, the module
  will be called parport_serial.o.

Use FIFO/DMA if available
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_FIFO
  Many parallel port chipsets provide hardware that can speed up
  printing. Say Y here if you want to take advantage of that.

  As well as actually having a FIFO, or DMA capability, the kernel
  will need to know which IRQ the parallel port has.  By default,
  parallel port interrupts will not be used, and so neither will the
  FIFO.  See <file:Documentation/parport.txt> to find out how to
  specify which IRQ/DMA to use.

SuperIO chipset support
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_SUPERIO
  Saying Y here enables some probes for Super-IO chipsets in order to
  find out things like base addresses, IRQ lines and DMA channels.  It
  is safe to say N.

Support for PCMCIA management for PC-style ports
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_PCMCIA
  Say Y here if you need PCMCIA support for your PC-style parallel
  ports. If unsure, say N.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  parport_cs.o

Support foreign hardware
CONFIG_PARPORT_OTHER
  Say Y here if you want to be able to load driver modules to support
  other non-standard types of parallel ports. This causes a
  performance loss, so most people say N.

Amiga built-in parallel port support
CONFIG_PARPORT_AMIGA
  Say Y here if you need support for the parallel port hardware on
  Amiga machines. This code is also available as a module (say M),
  called parport_amiga.o. If in doubt, saying N is the safe plan.

Atari built-in parallel port support
CONFIG_PARPORT_ATARI
  Say Y here if you need support for the parallel port hardware on
  Atari machines. This code is also available as a module (say M),
  called parport_atari.o. If in doubt, saying N is the safe plan.

Multiface III parallel port support
CONFIG_PARPORT_MFC3
  Say Y here if you need parallel port support for the MFC3 card.
  This code is also available as a module (say M), called
  parport_mfc3.o. If in doubt, saying N is the safe plan.

Support IEEE 1284 status readback
CONFIG_PRINTER_READBACK
  If you have a device on your parallel port that support this
  protocol, this option will allow the device to report its status. It
  is safe to say Y.

IEEE 1284 transfer modes
CONFIG_PARPORT_1284
  If you have a printer that supports status readback or device ID, or
  want to use a device that uses enhanced parallel port transfer modes
  such as EPP and ECP, say Y here to enable advanced IEEE 1284
  transfer modes. Also say Y if you want device ID information to
  appear in /proc/sys/dev/parportYYDELETEMEYYmsr - Model-specific register support
CONFIG_X86_MSR
  This device gives privileged processes access to the x86
  Model-Specific Registers (MSRs).  It is a character device with
  major 202 and minors 0 to 31 for /dev/cpu/0/msr to /dev/cpu/31/msr.
  MSR accesses are directed to a specific CPU on multi-processor
  systems.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  msr.o

/dev/cpu/*/cpuid - CPU information support
CONFIG_X86_CPUID
  This device gives processes access to the x86 CPUID instruction to
  be executed on a specific processor.  It is a character device
  with major 203 and minors 0 to 31 for /dev/cpu/0/cpuid to
  /dev/cpu/31/cpuid.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  cpuid.o

SBC-60XX Watchdog Timer
CONFIG_60XX_WDT
 This driver can be used with the watchdog timer found on some
 single board computers, namely the 6010 PII based computer.
 It may well work with other cards.  It reads port 0x443 to enable
 and re-set the watchdog timer, and reads port 0x45 to disable
 the watchdog.  If you have a card that behave in similar ways,
 you can probably make this driver work with your card as well.

 You can compile this driver directly into the kernel, or use
 it as a module.  The module will be called sbc60xxwdt.o.

Eurotech CPU-1220/1410 Watchdog Timer
CONFIG_EUROTECH_WDT
  Enable support for the watchdog timer on the Eurotech CPU-1220 and 
  CPU-1410 cards.  These are PC/104 SBCs. Spec sheets and product 
  information are at <http://www.eurotech.it/>.

W83877F Watchdog Timer
CONFIG_W83877F_WDT
 This is the driver for the hardware watchdog on the W83877F chipset
 as used in EMACS PC-104 motherboards (and may work on others). This
 watchdog simply watches your kernel to make sure it doesn't freeze,
 and if it does, it reboots your computer after a certain amount of
 time.

 You can compile this driver directly into the kernel, or use
 it as a module.  The module will be called w83877f_wdt.o.

SC520 (AMD Elan) Watchdog Timer
CONFIG_SC520_WDT
 This is the driver for the hardware watchdog built in to the
 AMD "Elan" SC520 microcomputer commonly used in embedded systems.
 This watchdog simply watches your kernel to make sure it doesn't
 freeze, and if it does, it reboots your computer after a certain
 amount of time.

 You can compile this driver directly into the kernel, or use
 it as a module.  The module will be called sc520_wdt.o.

Enhanced Real Time Clock Support
CONFIG_RTC
  If you say Y here and create a character special file /dev/rtc with
  major number 10 and minor number 135 using mknod ("man mknod"), you
  will get access to the real time clock (or hardware clock) built
  into your computer.

  Every PC has such a clock built in. It can be used to generate
  signals from as low as 1Hz up to 8192Hz, and can also be used
  as a 24 hour alarm. It reports status information via the file
  /proc/driver/rtc and its behaviour is set by various ioctls on
  /dev/rtc.

  If you run Linux on a multiprocessor machine and said Y to
  "Symmetric Multi Processing" above, you should say Y here to read
  and set the RTC in an SMP compatible fashion.

  If you think you have a use for such a device (such as periodic data
  sampling), then say Y here, and read <file:Documentation/rtc.txt>
  for details.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module is called rtc.o. If you want to compile it as a module,
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Tadpole ANA H8 Support
CONFIG_H8
  The Hitachi H8/337 is a microcontroller used to deal with the power
  and thermal environment. If you say Y here, you will be able to
  communicate with it via a character special device.

  If unsure, say N.

/dev/profile support
CONFIG_KERNPROF
  Saying Y here will compile in support for kernel profiling. To use it
  you need to create the character special device /dev/profile with
  major 192 and minor 0 using mknod. User-level commands such as kernprof
  and gprof can then be used to control the provided facilities and to
  generate user-readable profiles. If you do not want to profile the
  kernel, say N here.

  This driver is also available as a module (i.e., code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called kernprof.o.  If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt.

Function-entry instrumentation
CONFIG_MCOUNT
  This will instrument the kernel with calls to mcount(), which enables
  call-graph and call-count profiling.  Because mcount() is called at
  entry to each function, this will slow down execution somewhat.
  If you do not plan to use profiling, say N here.

  IMPORTANT NOTICE: Do not use this option if you compile the i386 kernel
  with stock gcc. If you do, the kernel will crash or hang at boot time.
  Find a simple patch at http://oss.sgi.com/projects/kernprof/download
  to modify egcs-1.1.2 and rebuild gcc.

Function-limit recursion
CONFIG_LIMIT_RECURS
  On certain hardware, call-graph profiling and exit instrumentation may
  cause kernel crashes because of excessive recursive invocations of the
  instrumentation functions.  Answer Y to limit the level of recursion
  permitted to 3.

/dev/nvram support
CONFIG_NVRAM
  If you say Y here and create a character special file /dev/nvram
  with major number 10 and minor number 144 using mknod ("man mknod"),
  you get read and write access to the extra bytes of non-volatile
  memory in the real time clock (RTC), which is contained in every PC
  and most Ataris.  The actual number of bytes varies, depending on the
  nvram in the system, but is usually 114 (128-14 for the RTC).

  This memory is conventionally called "CMOS RAM" on PCs and "NVRAM"
  on Ataris. /dev/nvram may be used to view settings there, or to
  change them (with some utility). It could also be used to frequently
  save a few bits of very important data that may not be lost over
  power-off and for which writing to disk is too insecure. Note
  however that most NVRAM space in a PC belongs to the BIOS and you
  should NEVER idly tamper with it. See Ralf Brown's interrupt list
  for a guide to the use of CMOS bytes by your BIOS.

  On Atari machines, /dev/nvram is always configured and does not need
  to be selected.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called nvram.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

NetWinder Button
CONFIG_NWBUTTON
  If you say Y here and create a character device node /dev/nwbutton
  with major and minor numbers 10 and 158 ("man mknod"), then every
  time the orange button is pressed a number of times, the number of
  times the button was pressed will be written to that device.

  This is most useful for applications, as yet unwritten, which
  perform actions based on how many times the button is pressed in a
  row.

  Do not hold the button down for too long, as the driver does not
  alter the behaviour of the hardware reset circuitry attached to the
  button; it will still execute a hard reset if the button is held
  down for longer than approximately five seconds.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called

  below to be able to initiate a system shutdown from the button.

Reboot Using Button
CONFIG_NWBUTTON_REBOOT
  If you say Y here, then you will be able to initiate a system
  shutdown and reboot by pressing the orange button a number of times.
  The number of presses to initiate the shutdown is two by default,
  but this can be altered by modifying the value of NUM_PRESSES_REBOOT
  in nwbutton.h and recompiling the driver or, if you compile the
  driver as a module, you can specify the number of presses at load
  time with "insmod button reboot_count=<something>".

CONFIG_SOUND
  If you have a sound card in your computer, i.e. if it can say more
  than an occasional beep, say Y.  Be sure to have all the information
  about your sound card and its configuration down (I/O port,
  interrupt and DMA channel), because you will be asked for it.

  You want to read the Sound-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. General information about
  the modular sound system is contained in the files
  <file:Documentation/sound/Introduction>.  The file
  <file:Documentation/sound/README.OSS> contains some slightly
  outdated but still useful information as well.

  If you have a PnP sound card and you want to configure it at boot
  time using the ISA PnP tools (read
  <http://www.roestock.demon.co.uk/isapnptools/>), then you need to
  compile the sound card support as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want)
  and load that module after the PnP configuration is finished.  To do
  this, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> as well
  as <file:Documentation/sound/README.modules>; the module will be
  called soundcore.o.

  I'm told that even without a sound card, you can make your computer
  say more than an occasional beep, by programming the PC speaker.
  Kernel patches and supporting utilities to do that are in the pcsp
  package, available at <ftp://ftp.infradead.org/pub/pcsp/>.

OSS sound modules
CONFIG_SOUND_OSS
  OSS is the Open Sound System suite of sound card drivers.  They make
  sound programming easier since they provide a common API.  Say Y or
  M here (the module will be called sound.o) if you haven't found a
  driver for your sound card above, then pick your driver from the
  list below.

Persistent DMA buffers
CONFIG_SOUND_DMAP
  Linux can often have problems allocating DMA buffers for ISA sound
  cards on machines with more than 16MB of RAM. This is because ISA
  DMA buffers must exist below the 16MB boundary and it is quite
  possible that a large enough free block in this region cannot be
  found after the machine has been running for a while. If you say Y
  here the DMA buffers (64Kb) will be allocated at boot time and kept
  until the shutdown. This option is only useful if you said Y to
  "OSS sound modules", above. If you said M to "OSS sound modules"
  then you can get the persistent DMA buffer functionality by passing
  the command-line argument "dmabuf=1" to the sound.o module.

  Say Y unless you have 16MB or less RAM or a PCI sound card.

Support for Aztech Sound Galaxy (non-PnP) cards
CONFIG_SOUND_SGALAXY
  This module initializes the older non Plug and Play sound galaxy
  cards from Aztech. It supports the Waverider Pro 32 - 3D and the
  Galaxy Washington 16.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "sgalaxy=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>,<sgbase>" to the kernel command
  line.

Support for AD1816(A) based cards
CONFIG_SOUND_AD1816
  Say M here if you have a sound card based on the Analog Devices
  AD1816(A) chip.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "ad1816=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>" to the kernel command line.

Yamaha OPL3-SA1 audio controller
CONFIG_SOUND_OPL3SA1
  Say Y or M if you have a Yamaha OPL3-SA1 sound chip, which is
  usually built into motherboards. Read
  <file:Documentation/sound/OPL3-SA> for details.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "opl3sa=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>,<mpuio>,<mpuirq>" to the kernel
  command line.

ProAudioSpectrum 16 support
CONFIG_SOUND_PAS
  Answer Y only if you have a Pro Audio Spectrum 16, ProAudio Studio
  16 or Logitech SoundMan 16 sound card. Answer N if you have some
  other card made by Media Vision or Logitech since those are not
  PAS16 compatible. Please read <file:Documentation/sound/PAS16>.
  It is not necessary to add Sound Blaster support separately; it
  is included in PAS support.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "pas2=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>,<sbio>,<sbirq>,<sbdma>,<sbdma2>
  to the kernel command line.

Enable PAS16 joystick port
CONFIG_PAS_JOYSTICK
  Say Y here to enable the Pro Audio Spectrum 16's auxiliary joystick
  port.

100% Sound Blaster compatibles (SB16/32/64, ESS, Jazz16) support
CONFIG_SOUND_SB
  Answer Y if you have an original Sound Blaster card made by Creative
  Labs or a 100% hardware compatible clone (like the Thunderboard or
  SM Games). For an unknown card you may answer Y if the card claims
  to be Sound Blaster-compatible.

  Please read the file <file:Documentation/sound/Soundblaster>.

  You should also say Y here for cards based on the Avance Logic
  ALS-007 and ALS-1X0 chips (read <file:Documentation/sound/ALS>) and
  for cards based on ESS chips (read
  <file:Documentation/sound/ESS1868> and
  <file:Documentation/sound/ESS>). If you have an SB AWE 32 or SB AWE
  64, say Y here and also to "AWE32 synth" below and read
  <file:Documentation/sound/INSTALL.awe>. If you have an IBM Mwave
  card, say Y here and read <file:Documentation/sound/mwave>.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel and don't want to use
  isapnp, you have to add "sb=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>" to the kernel
  command line.

  You can say M here to compile this driver as a module; the module is
  called sb.o.

Gravis Ultrasound support
CONFIG_SOUND_GUS
  Say Y here for any type of Gravis Ultrasound card, including the GUS
  or GUS MAX.  See also <file:Documentation/sound/ultrasound> for more
  information on configuring this card with modules.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "gus=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>" to the kernel command line.

MPU-401 support (NOT for SB16)
CONFIG_SOUND_MPU401
  Be careful with this question.  The MPU401 interface is supported by
  all sound cards.  However, some natively supported cards have their
  own driver for MPU401.  Enabling this MPU401 option with these cards
  will cause a conflict.  Also, enabling MPU401 on a system that
  doesn't really have a MPU401 could cause some trouble.  If your card
  was in the list of supported cards, look at the card specific
  instructions in the <file:Documentation/sound/README.OSS> file.  It
  is safe to answer Y if you have a true MPU401 MIDI interface card.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "mpu401=<io>,<irq>" to the kernel command line.

6850 UART support
CONFIG_SOUND_UART6850
  This option enables support for MIDI interfaces based on the 6850
  UART chip. This interface is rarely found on sound cards. It's safe
  to answer N to this question.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "uart6850=<io>,<irq>" to the kernel command line.

PSS (AD1848, ADSP-2115, ESC614) support
CONFIG_SOUND_PSS
  Answer Y or M if you have an Orchid SW32, Cardinal DSP16, Beethoven
  ADSP-16 or some other card based on the PSS chipset (AD1848 codec +
  ADSP-2115 DSP chip + Echo ESC614 ASIC CHIP). For more information on
  how to compile it into the kernel or as a module see the file
  <file:Documentation/sound/PSS>.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "pss=<io>,<mssio>,<mssirq>,<mssdma>,<mpuio>,<mpuirq>" to the kernel
  command line.

Enable PSS mixer (Beethoven ADSP-16 and other compatible)
CONFIG_PSS_MIXER
  Answer Y for Beethoven ADSP-16. You may try to say Y also for other
  cards if they have master volume, bass, treble, and you can't
  control it under Linux. If you answer N for Beethoven ADSP-16, you
  can't control master volume, bass, treble and synth volume.

  If you said M to "PSS support" above, you may enable or disable this
  PSS mixer with the module parameter pss_mixer. For more information
  see the file <file:Documentation/sound/PSS>.

Have DSPxxx.LD firmware file
CONFIG_PSS_HAVE_BOOT
  If you have the DSPxxx.LD file or SYNTH.LD file for you card, say Y
  to include this file. Without this file the synth device (OPL) may
  not work.

Full pathname of DSPxxx.LD firmware file
CONFIG_PSS_BOOT_FILE
  Enter the full pathname of your DSPxxx.LD file or SYNTH.LD file,
  starting from /.

Microsoft Sound System support
CONFIG_SOUND_MSS
  Again think carefully before answering Y to this question.  It's
  safe to answer Y if you have the original Windows Sound System card
  made by Microsoft or Aztech SG 16 Pro (or NX16 Pro).  Also you may
  say Y in case your card is NOT among these:

     ATI Stereo F/X, AdLib, Audio Excell DSP16, Cardinal DSP16,
     Ensoniq SoundScape (and compatibles made by Reveal and Spea),
     Gravis Ultrasound, Gravis Ultrasound ACE, Gravis Ultrasound Max,
     Gravis Ultrasound with 16 bit option, Logitech Sound Man 16,
     Logitech SoundMan Games, Logitech SoundMan Wave, MAD16 Pro (OPTi
     82C929), Media Vision Jazz16, MediaTriX AudioTriX Pro, Microsoft
     Windows Sound System (MSS/WSS), Mozart (OAK OTI-601), Orchid
     SW32, Personal Sound System (PSS), Pro Audio Spectrum 16, Pro
     Audio Studio 16, Pro Sonic 16, Roland MPU-401 MIDI interface,
     Sound Blaster 1.0, Sound Blaster 16, Sound Blaster 16ASP, Sound
     Blaster 2.0, Sound Blaster AWE32, Sound Blaster Pro, TI TM4000M
     notebook, ThunderBoard, Turtle Beach Tropez, Yamaha FM
     synthesizers (OPL2, OPL3 and OPL4), 6850 UART MIDI Interface.

  For cards having native support in VoxWare, consult the card
  specific instructions in <file:Documentation/sound/README.OSS>.
  Some drivers have their own MSS support and saying Y to this option
  will cause a conflict.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "ad1848=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>[,<type>]" to the kernel command
  line.

SGI Visual Workstation on-board audio
CONFIG_SOUND_VWSND
  Say Y or M if you have an SGI Visual Workstation and you want to be
  able to use its on-board audio.  Read
  <file:Documentation/sound/vwsnd> for more info on this driver's
  capabilities.

NEC Vrc5477 AC97 sound
CONFIG_SOUND_VRC5477
  Say Y here to enable sound support for the NEC Vrc5477 chip, an
  integrated, multi-function controller chip for MIPS CPUs.  Works
  with the AC97 codec.

Ensoniq SoundScape support
CONFIG_SOUND_SSCAPE
  Answer Y if you have a sound card based on the Ensoniq SoundScape
  chipset. Such cards are being manufactured at least by Ensoniq, Spea
  and Reveal (Reveal makes also other cards).

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "sscape=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<mpuio>,<mpuirq>" to the kernel command
  line.

MediaTriX AudioTriX Pro support
CONFIG_SOUND_TRIX
  Answer Y if you have the AudioTriX Pro sound card manufactured
  by MediaTrix.

Have TRXPRO.HEX firmware file
CONFIG_TRIX_HAVE_BOOT
  The MediaTrix AudioTrix Pro has an on-board microcontroller which
  needs to be initialized by downloading the code from the file
  TRXPRO.HEX in the DOS driver directory. If you don't have the
  TRXPRO.HEX file handy you may skip this step. However, the SB and
  MPU-401 modes of AudioTrix Pro will not work without this file!

Full pathname of TRXPRO.HEX firmware file
CONFIG_TRIX_BOOT_FILE
  Enter the full pathname of your TRXPRO.HEX file, starting from /.

Support for OPTi MAD16 and/or Mozart based cards
CONFIG_SOUND_MAD16
  Answer Y if your card has a Mozart (OAK OTI-601) or MAD16 (OPTi
  82C928 or 82C929 or 82C931) audio interface chip. These chips are
  quite common so it's possible that many no-name cards have one of
  them. In addition the MAD16 chip is used in some cards made by known
  manufacturers such as Turtle Beach (Tropez), Reveal (some models)
  and Diamond (latest ones). Note however that the Tropez sound cards
  have their own driver; if you have one of those, say N here and Y or
  M to "Full support for Turtle Beach WaveFront", below.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "mad16=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>,<mpuio>,<mpuirq>" to the
  kernel command line.

  See also <file:Documentation/sound/Opti> and
  <file:Documentation/sound/MAD16> for more information on setting
  these cards up as modules.

Full support for Turtle Beach WaveFront (Tropez Plus, Tropez, Maui) synth/sound cards
CONFIG_SOUND_WAVEFRONT
  Answer Y or M if you have a Tropez Plus, Tropez or Maui sound card
  and read the files <file:Documentation/sound/Wavefront> and
  <file:Documentation/sound/Tropez+>.

Support MIDI in older MAD16 based cards (requires SB)
CONFIG_MAD16_OLDCARD
  Answer Y (or M) if you have an older card based on the C928 or
  Mozart chipset and you want to have MIDI support. If you enable this
  option you also need to enable support for Sound Blaster.

Support for Crystal CS4232 based (PnP) cards
CONFIG_SOUND_CS4232
  Say Y here if you have a card based on the Crystal CS4232 chip set,
  which uses its own Plug and Play protocol.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "cs4232=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>,<mpuio>,<mpuirq>" to the kernel
  command line.

  See <file:Documentation/sound/CS4232> for more information on
  configuring this card.

Support for Yamaha OPL3-SA2 and SA3 based PnP cards
CONFIG_SOUND_OPL3SA2
  Say Y or M if you have a card based on one of these Yamaha sound
  chipsets or the "SAx", which is actually a SA3. Read
  <file:Documentation/sound/OPL3-SA2> for more information on
  configuring these cards.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel and do not also
  configure in the optional ISA PnP support, you will have to add
  "opl3sa2=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>,<mssio>,<mpuio>" to the kernel
  command line.

Support for Turtle Beach Wave Front (Maui, Tropez) synthesizers
CONFIG_SOUND_MAUI
  Say Y here if you have a Turtle Beach Wave Front, Maui, or Tropez
  sound card.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "maui=<io>,<irq>" to the kernel command line.

Have OSWF.MOT firmware file
CONFIG_MAUI_HAVE_BOOT
  Turtle Beach Maui and Tropez sound cards have a microcontroller
  which needs to be initialized prior to use. OSWF.MOT is a file
  distributed with the card's DOS/Windows drivers. Answer Y if you
  have this file.

Full pathname of OSWF.MOT firmware file
CONFIG_MAUI_BOOT_FILE
  Enter the full pathname of your OSWF.MOT file, starting from /.

Support for Turtle Beach MultiSound Classic, Tahiti, Monterey
CONFIG_SOUND_MSNDCLAS
  Say M here if you have a Turtle Beach MultiSound Classic, Tahiti or
  Monterey (not for the Pinnacle or Fiji).

  See <file:Documentation/sound/MultiSound> for important information
  about this driver.  Note that it has been discontinued, but the
  Voyetra Turtle Beach knowledge base entry for it is still available
  at <http://www.voyetra-turtle-beach.com/site/kb_ftp/790.asp>.

  The MultiSound cards have two firmware files which are required for
  operation, and are not currently included. These files can be
  obtained from Turtle Beach. See
  <file:Documentation/sound/MultiSound> for information on how to
  obtain this.

MSND Pinnacle has S/PDIF I/O
CONFIG_MSNDPIN_DIGITAL
  If you have the S/PDIF daughter board for the Pinnacle or Fiji,
  answer Y here; otherwise, say N. If you have this, you will be able
  to play and record from the S/PDIF port (digital signal). See
  <file:Documentation/sound/MultiSound> for information on how to make
  use of this capability.

MSND Pinnacle non-PnP Mode
CONFIG_MSNDPIN_NONPNP
  The Pinnacle and Fiji card resources can be configured either with
  PnP, or through a configuration port. Say Y here if your card is NOT
  in PnP mode. For the Pinnacle, configuration in non-PnP mode allows
  use of the IDE and joystick peripherals on the card as well; these
  do not show up when the card is in PnP mode. Specifying zero for any
  resource of a device will disable the device. If you are running the
  card in PnP mode, you must say N here and use isapnptools to
  configure the card's resources.

MSND Pinnacle config port
CONFIG_MSNDPIN_CFG
  This is the port which the Pinnacle and Fiji uses to configure the
  card's resources when not in PnP mode. If your card is in PnP mode,
  then be sure to say N to the previous option, "MSND Pinnacle Non-PnP
  Mode".

MSND buffer size (kB)
CONFIG_MSND_FIFOSIZE
  Configures the size of each audio buffer, in kilobytes, for
  recording and playing in the MultiSound drivers (both the Classic
  and Pinnacle). Larger values reduce the chance of data overruns at
  the expense of overall latency. If unsure, use the default.

Yamaha FM synthesizer (YM3812/OPL-3) support
CONFIG_SOUND_YM3812
  Answer Y if your card has a FM chip made by Yamaha (OPL2/OPL3/OPL4).
  Answering Y is usually a safe and recommended choice, however some
  cards may have software (TSR) FM emulation. Enabling FM support with
  these cards may cause trouble (I don't currently know of any such
  cards, however). Please read the file
  <file:Documentation/sound/OPL3> if your card has an OPL3 chip.

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "opl3=<io>" to the kernel command line.

  If unsure, say Y.

ACI mixer (miroSOUND PCM1-pro/PCM12/PCM20 radio)
CONFIG_SOUND_ACI_MIXER
  ACI (Audio Command Interface) is a protocol used to communicate with
  the microcontroller on some sound cards produced by miro and
  Cardinal Technologies.  The main function of the ACI is to control
  the mixer and to get a product identification.

  This VoxWare ACI driver currently supports the ACI functions on the
  miroSOUND PCM1-pro, PCM12 and PCM20 radio. On the PCM20 radio, ACI
  also controls the radio tuner. This is supported in the video4linux
  miropcm20 driver (say M or Y here and go back to "Multimedia
  devices" -> "Radio Adapters").

  This driver is also available as a module and will be called aci.o.

SB32/AWE support
CONFIG_SOUND_AWE32_SYNTH
  Say Y here if you have a Sound Blaster SB32, AWE32-PnP, SB AWE64 or
  similar sound card. See <file:Documentation/sound/README.awe>,
  <file:Documentation/sound/AWE32> and the Soundblaster-AWE
  mini-HOWTO, available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>
  for more info.

Gallant Audio Cards (SC-6000 and SC-6600 based)
CONFIG_SOUND_AEDSP16
  Answer Y if you have a Gallant's Audio Excel DSP 16 card. This
  driver supports Audio Excel DSP 16 but not the III nor PnP versions
  of this card.

  The Gallant's Audio Excel DSP 16 card can emulate either an SBPro or
  a Microsoft Sound System card, so you should have said Y to either
  "100% Sound Blaster compatibles (SB16/32/64, ESS, Jazz16) support"
  or "Microsoft Sound System support", above, and you need to answer
  the "MSS emulation" and "SBPro emulation" questions below
  accordingly. You should say Y to one and only one of these two
  questions.

  Read the <file:Documentation/sound/README.OSS> file and the head of
  <file:drivers/sound/aedsp16.c> as well as
  <file:Documentation/sound/AudioExcelDSP16> to get more information
  about this driver and its configuration.

Audio Excel DSP 16 (SBPro emulation)
CONFIG_AEDSP16_SBPRO
  Answer Y if you want your audio card to emulate Sound Blaster Pro.
  You should then say Y to "100% Sound Blaster compatibles
  (SB16/32/64, ESS, Jazz16) support" and N to "Audio Excel DSP 16 (MSS
  emulation)".

  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
  "aedsp16=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<mssio>,<mpuio>,<mouirq>" to the kernel
  command line.

Audio Excel DSP 16 (MSS emulation)
CONFIG_AEDSP16_MSS
  Answer Y if you want your audio card to emulate Microsoft Sound
  System. You should then say Y to "Microsoft Sound System support"
  and say N to "Audio Excel DSP 16 (SBPro emulation)".

SC-6600 based audio cards (new Audio Excel DSP 16)
CONFIG_SC6600
  The SC6600 is the new version of DSP mounted on the Audio Excel DSP
  16 cards. Find in the manual the FCC ID of your audio card and
  answer Y if you have an SC6600 DSP.

SC-6600 Joystick Interface
CONFIG_SC6600_JOY
  Say Y here in order to use the joystick interface of the Audio Excel
  DSP 16 card.

SC-6600 CD-ROM Interface
CONFIG_SC6600_CDROM  (4=None, 3=IDE, 1=Panasonic, 0=Sony)
  This is used to activate the CD-ROM interface of the Audio Excel
  DSP 16 card. Enter: 0 for Sony, 1 for Panasonic, 2 for IDE, 4 for no
  CD-ROM present.

SC-6600 CD-ROM Interface I/O Address
CONFIG_SC6600_CDROMBASE
  Base I/O port address for the CD-ROM interface of the Audio Excel
  DSP 16 card.

Audio Excel DSP 16 (MPU401 emulation)
CONFIG_AEDSP16_MPU401
  Answer Y if you want your audio card to emulate the MPU-401 midi
  interface. You should then also say Y to "MPU-401 support".

  Note that the I/O base for MPU-401 support of aedsp16 is the same
  you have selected for "MPU-401 support". If you are using this
  driver as a module you have to specify the MPU I/O base address with
  the parameter 'mpu_base=0xNNN'.

SC-6600 CDROM Interface (4=None, 3=IDE, 1=Panasonic, 0=?Sony?)
CONFIG_SC6600_CDROM
  This is used to activate the CD-ROM interface of the Audio Excel
  DSP 16 card. Enter: 0 for Sony, 1 for Panasonic, 2 for IDE, 4 for no
  CD-ROM present.

CONFIG_SOUND_CMPCI_SPEAKERS
  Specify the number of speaker channels you want the card to drive,
  as an integer.

Enable S/PDIF loop for CMI8738
CONFIG_SOUND_CMPCI_SPDIFLOOP
  Enable loopback from SPDIF in to SPDIF out.  For discussion, see
  "The 8738 Audio SPDIF In/Out Technical Data" on the technical
  support page at <http://www.cmedia.com.tw/>.

  A userspace utility to control even more internal registers of these
  chips is available at
  <http://member.nifty.ne.jp/Breeze/softwares/unix/cmictl-e.html>.
  This package will among other things help you enable SPDIF 
  out/in/loop/monitor.

Enable legacy FM

  Enable low-level debugging assertion macros in the kernel code.
  Currently used only by the time services code in the MIPS port.
  Don't turn this on unless you know what you are doing.

Remote GDB kernel debugging
CONFIG_REMOTE_DEBUG
  If you say Y here, it will be possible to remotely debug the MIPS
  kernel using gdb. This enlarges your kernel image disk size by
  several megabytes and requires a machine with more than 16 MB,
  better 32 MB RAM to avoid excessive linking time. This is only
  useful for kernel hackers. If unsure, say N.

Run uncached
CONFIG_MIPS_UNCACHED
  If you say Y here there kernel will disable all CPU caches.  This will
  reduce the system's performance dramatically but can help finding
  otherwise hard to track bugs.  It can also useful if you're doing
  hardware debugging with a logic analyzer and need to see all traffic
  on the bus.

  If you say Y here, you will have some control over the system even
  if the system crashes for example during kernel debugging (e.g., you
  will be able to flush the buffer cache to disk, reboot the system
  immediately or dump some status information). This is accomplished
  by pressing various keys while holding SysRq (Alt+PrintScreen). It
  also works on a serial console (on PC hardware at least), if you
  send a BREAK and then within 5 seconds a command keypress. The
  keys are documented in <file:Documentation/sysrq.txt>. Don't say Y
  unless you really know what this hack does.

ISDN support
CONFIG_ISDN
  ISDN ("Integrated Services Digital Networks", called RNIS in France)
  is a special type of fully digital telephone service; it's mostly
  used to connect to your Internet service provider (with SLIP or
  PPP).  The main advantage is that the speed is higher than ordinary
  modem/telephone connections, and that you can have voice
  conversations while downloading stuff.  It only works if your
  computer is equipped with an ISDN card and both you and your service
  provider purchased an ISDN line from the phone company.  For
  details, read <http://alumni.caltech.edu/~dank/isdn/> on the WWW.

  This driver allows you to use an ISDN-card for networking
  connections and as dialin/out device.  The isdn-tty's have a built
  in AT-compatible modem emulator.  Network devices support autodial,
  channel-bundling, callback and caller-authentication without having
  a daemon running.  A reduced T.70 protocol is supported with tty's
  suitable for German BTX.  On D-Channel, the protocols EDSS1
  (Euro-ISDN) and 1TR6 (German style) are supported.  See
  <file:Documentation/isdn/README> for more information.

  If you want to compile the ISDN code as a module ( = code which can
  be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want), say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The
  module will be called isdn.o. If unsure, say N.

Support synchronous PPP
CONFIG_ISDN_PPP
  Over digital connections such as ISDN, there is no need to
  synchronize sender and recipient's clocks with start and stop bits
  as is done over analog telephone lines. Instead, one can use
  "synchronous PPP". Saying Y here will include this protocol. This
  protocol is used by Cisco and Sun for example. So you want to say Y
  here if the other end of your ISDN connection supports it. You will
  need a special version of pppd (called ipppd) for using this
  feature. See <file:Documentation/isdn/README.syncppp> and
  <file:Documentation/isdn/syncPPP.FAQ> for more information.

Support generic MP (RFC 1717)
CONFIG_ISDN_MPP
  With synchronous PPP enabled, it is possible to increase throughput
  by bundling several ISDN-connections, using this protocol. See
  <file:Documentation/isdn/README.syncppp> for more information.

Use VJ-compression with synchronous PPP
CONFIG_ISDN_PPP_VJ
  This enables Van Jacobson header compression for synchronous PPP.
  Say Y if the other end of the connection supports it.

Support BSD compression
CONFIG_ISDN_PPP_BSDCOMP
  Support for the BSD-Compress compression method for PPP, which uses
  the LZW compression method to compress each PPP packet before it is
  sent over the wire. The machine at the other end of the PPP link
  (usually your ISP) has to support the BSD-Compress compression
  method as well for this to be useful. Even if they don't support it,
  it is safe to say Y here.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called isdn_bsdcomp.o.

Support audio via ISDN
CONFIG_ISDN_AUDIO
  If you say Y here, the modem-emulator will support a subset of the
  EIA Class 8 Voice commands. Using a getty with voice-support
  (mgetty+sendfax by gert@greenie.muc.de with an extension, available
  with the ISDN utility package for example), you will be able to use
  your Linux box as an ISDN-answering machine. Of course, this must be
  supported by the lowlevel driver also. Currently, the HiSax driver
  is the only voice-supporting driver. See
  <file:Documentation/isdn/README.audio> for more information.

X.25 PLP on top of ISDN
CONFIG_ISDN_X25
  This feature provides the X.25 protocol over ISDN connections.
  See <file:Documentation/isdn/README.x25> for more information
  if you are thinking about using this.

ISDN diversion services support
CONFIG_ISDN_DIVERSION
  This option allows you to use some supplementary diversion
  services in conjunction with the HiSax driver on an EURO/DSS1
  line.

  Supported options are CD (call deflection), CFU (Call forward
  unconditional), CFB (Call forward when busy) and CFNR (call forward
  not reachable). Additionally the actual CFU, CFB and CFNR state may
  be interrogated.

  The use of CFU, CFB, CFNR and interrogation may be limited to some
  countries. The keypad protocol is still not implemented. CD should
  work in all countries if the service has been subscribed to.

  Please read the file <file:Documentation/isdn/README.diversion>.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called dss1_divert.o.

ICN 2B and 4B support
CONFIG_ISDN_DRV_ICN
  This enables support for two kinds of ISDN-cards made by a German
  company called ICN.  2B is the standard version for a single ISDN
  line with two B-channels, 4B supports two ISDN lines.  For running
  this card, additional firmware is necessary, which has to be
  downloaded into the card using a utility which is distributed
  separately.  See <file:Documentation/isdn/README> and
  <file:Documentation/isdn/README.icn> for more
  information.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called icn.o.

isdnloop support
CONFIG_ISDN_DRV_LOOP
  This driver provides a virtual ISDN card. Its primary purpose is
  testing of linklevel features or configuration without getting
  charged by your service-provider for lots of phone calls.
  You need will need the loopctrl utility from the latest isdn4k-utils
  package to set up this driver.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called isdnloop.o.

HiSax SiemensChipSet driver support

  This is a driver supporting the Siemens chipset on various
  ISDN-cards (like AVM A1, Elsa ISDN cards, Teles S0-16.0, Teles
  S0-16.3, Teles S0-8, Teles/Creatix PnP, ITK micro ix1 and many
  compatibles).

  HiSax is just the name of this driver, not the name of any hardware.

  If you have a card with such a chipset, you should say Y here and
  also to the configuration option of the driver for your particular
  card, below.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called hisax.o.  See <file:Documentation/isdn/README.HiSax>
  for more information on using this driver.

  upper level of the isdn code on each AOCD (Advice Of Charge, During
  the call -- transmission of the fee information during a call) and
  on each AOCE (Advice Of Charge, at the End of the call --
  transmission of fee information at the end of the call), say Y here.
  This works only in Germany.

CONFIG_BLUEZ_USB_ZERO_PACKET
  Support for USB zero packets.
  This option is provided only as a work around for buggy Bluetooth USB 
  devices. Do _not_ enable it unless you know for sure that your device 
  requires zero packets.
  Most people should say N here.

HCI VHCI Virtual HCI device driver
CONFIG_BLUEZ_HCIVHCI
  Bluetooth Virtual HCI device driver.
  This driver is required if you want to use HCI Emulation software.

  Say Y here to compile support for virtual HCI devices into the
  kernel or say M to compile it as module (hci_vhci.o).

HCI DTL1 (PC Card) device driver

  Bluetooth HCI DTL1 (PC Card) driver.
  This driver provides support for Bluetooth PCMCIA devices with
  Nokia DTL1 interface:
     Nokia Bluetooth Card

  kernel or say M to compile it as module (dtl1_cs.o).

HCI BT3C (PC Card) device driver
CONFIG_BLUEZ_HCIBT3C
  Bluetooth HCI BT3C (PC Card) driver.
  This driver provides support for Bluetooth PCMCIA devices with
  3Com BT3C interface:
     3Com Bluetooth Card (3CRWB6096)
     HP Bluetooth Card

# The following options are for Linux when running on the Hitachi
# SuperH family of RISC microprocessors.

SuperH RTC support
CONFIG_SH_RTC
  Selecting this option will allow the Linux kernel to emulate
  PC's RTC.

  If unsure, say N.

SuperH DMAC support
CONFIG_SH_DMA
  Selecting this option will provide same API as PC's Direct Memory
  Access Controller(8237A) for SuperH DMAC.

  If unsure, say N.

# Choice: cf_area
CompactFlash Connection Area
CONFIG_CF_AREA5
  If your board has "Directly Connected" CompactFlash, You should
  select the area where your CF is connected to.
  
  - "Area5" if CompactFlash is connected to Area 5 (0x14000000)
  - "Area6" if it is connected to Area 6 (0x18000000)

  "Area6" will work for most boards. For ADX, select "Area5".

Disable data cache

# m68k-specific kernel options
# Documented by Chris Lawrence <mailto:quango@themall.net> et al.
#
Amiga support
CONFIG_AMIGA
  This option enables support for the Amiga series of computers. If
  you plan to use this kernel on an Amiga, say Y here and browse the
  material available in <file:Documentation/m68k>; otherwise say N.

Commodore A2232 serial support
CONFIG_A2232
  This option supports the 2232 7-port serial card shipped with the
  Amiga 2000 and other Zorro-bus machines, dating from 1989.  At
  a max of 19,200 bps, the ports are served by a 6551 ACIA UART chip
  each, plus a 8520 CIA, and a master 6502 CPU and buffer as well. The
  ports were connected with 8 pin DIN connectors on the card bracket,
  for which 8 pin to DB25 adapters were supplied. The card also had
  jumpers internally to toggle various pinning configurations.

  This driver can be built as a module; but then "generic_serial.o"
  will also be built as a module. This has to be loaded before
  "ser_a2232.o". If you want to do this, answer M here and read
  "<file:Documentation/modules.txt>".

A4000T SCSI support
CONFIG_A4000T_SCSI
  Support for the NCR53C710 SCSI controller on the Amiga 4000T.

A4091 SCSI support
CONFIG_A4091_SCSI
  Support for the NCR53C710 chip on the Amiga 4091 Z3 SCSI2 controller
  (1993).  Very obscure -- the 4091 was part of an Amiga 4000 upgrade
  plan at the time the Amiga business was sold to DKB.

Atari support
CONFIG_ATARI
  This option enables support for the 68000-based Atari series of
  computers (including the TT, Falcon and Medusa). If you plan to use
  this kernel on an Atari, say Y here and browse the material
  available in <file:Documentation/m68k>; otherwise say N.

Hades support
CONFIG_HADES
  This option enables support for the Hades Atari clone. If you plan
  to use this kernel on a Hades, say Y here; otherwise say N.

Macintosh support
CONFIG_MAC
  This option enables support for the Apple Macintosh series of
  computers (yes, there is experimental support now, at least for part
  of the series).

  Say N unless you're willing to code the remaining necessary support.
  ;)

HP9000/300 support
CONFIG_HP300
  This option enables support for the HP9000/300 series of
  workstations. Support for these machines is still very experimental.
  If you plan to try to use the kernel on such a machine say Y here.
  Everybody else says N.

Q40/Q60 support
CONFIG_Q40
  The Q40 is a Motorola 68040-based successor to the Sinclair QL
  manufactured in Germany.  There is an official Q40 home page at
  <http://www.q40.de/>.  This option enables support for the Q40 and
  Q60. Select your CPU below.  For 68LC060 don't forget to enable FPU
  emulation.

Q40/Q60 IDE interface support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_Q40IDE
  Enable the on-board IDE controller in the Q40/Q60.  This should
  normally be on; disable it only if you are running a custom hard
  drive subsystem through an expansion card.

Sun 3 support
CONFIG_SUN3
  This option enables support for the Sun 3 series of workstations.
  Note that if this option is enabled, support for all other m68k 
  platforms above must be disabled in order to produce a working 
  kernel.

  Also, you will want to enable 68020 support below, and disable 
  all other CPU types.  General Linux information on the Sun 3x series
  (now discontinued) is at
  <http://www.angelfire.com/ca2/tech68k/sun3.html>.

  If you don't want to compile a kernel for a Sun 3, say N.

Sun 3X support
CONFIG_SUN3X
  This option enables support for the Sun 3x series of workstations.
  Currently, only the Sun 3/80 is supported within the Sun 3x family.
  You will also want to enable 68030 support below  
  General Linux information on the Sun 3x series (now discontinued)
  is at <http://www.angelfire.com/ca2/tech68k/sun3.html>.

  If you don't want to compile a kernel for a Sun 3x, say N.

Sun3x builtin serial support
CONFIG_SUN3X_ZS
  ZS refers to a type of asynchronous serial port built in to the Sun3
  and Sun3x workstations; if you have a Sun 3, you probably have
  these.  Say 'Y' to support ZS ports directly.  This option must be
  enabled in order to support the keyboard and mouse ports.

Sun keyboard support
CONFIG_SUN_KEYBOARD
  Say Y here to support the keyboard found on Sun 3 and 3x
  workstations.  It can also be used support Sun Type-5 keyboards
  through an adaptor.  See
  <http://www.suse.cz/development/input/adapters.html> and
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxconsole/> for details on the
  latter.

68020 support
CONFIG_M68020
  If you anticipate running this kernel on a computer with a MC68020
  processor, say Y. Otherwise, say N. Note that the 68020 requires a
  68851 MMU (Memory Management Unit) to run Linux/m68k, except on the
  Sun 3, which provides its own version.

68030 support
CONFIG_M68030
  If you anticipate running this kernel on a computer with a MC68030
  processor, say Y. Otherwise, say N. Note that a MC68EC030 will not
  work, as it does not include an MMU (Memory Management Unit).

68040 support
CONFIG_M68040
  If you anticipate running this kernel on a computer with a MC68LC040
  or MC68040 processor, say Y. Otherwise, say N. Note that an
  MC68EC040 will not work, as it does not include an MMU (Memory
  Management Unit).

68060 support
CONFIG_M68060
  If you anticipate running this kernel on a computer with a MC68060
  processor, say Y. Otherwise, say N.

Math emulation support
CONFIG_M68KFPU_EMU
  At some point in the future, this will cause floating-point math
  instructions to be emulated by the kernel on machines that lack a
  floating-point math coprocessor.  Thrill-seekers and chronically
  sleep-deprived psychotic hacker types can say Y now, everyone else
  should probably wait a while.

Math emulation only kernel
CONFIG_M68KFPU_EMU_ONLY
  This option prevents any floating-point instructions from being
  compiled into the kernel, thereby the kernel doesn't save any
  floating point context anymore during task switches, so this
  kernel will only be usable on machines without a floating-point
  math coprocessor. This makes the kernel a bit faster as no tests
  needs to be executed whether a floating-point instruction in the
  kernel should be executed or not.

Math emulation extra precision
CONFIG_M68KFPU_EMU_EXTRAPREC
  The fpu uses normally a few bit more during calculations for
  correct rounding, the emulator can (often) do the same but this
  extra calculation can cost quite some time, so you can disable
  it here. The emulator will then "only" calculate with a 64 bit
  mantissa and round slightly incorrect, what is more then enough
  for normal usage.

Advanced configuration options
CONFIG_ADVANCED
  This gives you access to some advanced options for the CPU. The
  defaults should be fine for most users, but these options may make
  it possible for you to improve performance somewhat if you know what
  you are doing.

  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
  the questions about these options.

  Most users should say N to this question.

Use one physical chunk of memory only
CONFIG_SINGLE_MEMORY_CHUNK
  Ignore all but the first contiguous chunk of physical memory for VM
  purposes.  This will save a few bytes kernel size and may speed up
  some operations.  Say N if not sure.

Use read-modify-write instructions
CONFIG_RMW_INSNS
  This allows to use certain instructions that work with indivisible
  read-modify-write bus cycles. While this is faster than the
  workaround of disabling interrupts, it can conflict with DMA
  ( = direct memory access) on many Amiga systems, and it is also said
  to destabilize other machines. It is very likely that this will
  cause serious problems on any Amiga or Atari Medusa if set. The only
  configuration where it should work are 68030-based Ataris, where it
  apparently improves performance. But you've been warned! Unless you
  really know what you are doing, say N. Try Y only if you're quite
  adventurous.

Amiga Zorro (AutoConfig) bus support
CONFIG_ZORRO
  This enables support for the Zorro bus in the Amiga. If you have
  expansion cards in your Amiga that conform to the Amiga
  AutoConfig(tm) specification, say Y, otherwise N. Note that even
  expansion cards that do not fit in the Zorro slots but fit in e.g.
  the CPU slot may fall in this category, so you have to say Y to let
  Linux use these.

Zorro device name database
CONFIG_ZORRO_NAMES
  By default, the kernel contains a database of all known Zorro device
  names to make the information in /proc/iomem comprehensible to the
  user. This database increases the size of the kernel image by about
  15KB, but it gets freed after the system boots up, so it doesn't
  take up kernel memory. Anyway, if you are building an installation
  floppy or kernel for an embedded system where kernel image size
  really matters, you can disable this feature and you'll get device
  ID numbers instead of names.

  When in doubt, say Y.

Amiga 1200/600 PCMCIA support
CONFIG_AMIGA_PCMCIA
  Include support in the kernel for pcmcia on Amiga 1200 and Amiga
  600. If you intend to use pcmcia cards say Y; otherwise say N.

Hisoft Whippet PCMCIA serial support
CONFIG_WHIPPET_SERIAL
  HiSoft has a web page at <http://www.hisoft.co.uk/>, but there
  is no listing for the Whippet in their Amiga section.

Amiga Zorro II ramdisk support
CONFIG_AMIGA_Z2RAM
  This enables support for using Chip RAM and Zorro II RAM as a
  ramdisk or as a swap partition. Say Y if you want to include this
  driver in the kernel. This driver is also available as a module
  ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the running
  kernel whenever you want). The module is called z2ram.o. If you want
  to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Support for ST-RAM as swap space
CONFIG_STRAM_SWAP
  Some Atari 68k machines (including the 520STF and 1020STE) divide
  their addressable memory into ST and TT sections.  The TT section
  (up to 512MB) is the main memory; the ST section (up to 4MB) is
  accessible to the built-in graphics board, runs slower, and is
  present mainly for backward compatibility with older machines.

  This enables support for using (parts of) ST-RAM as swap space,
  instead of as normal system memory. This can first enhance system
  performance if you have lots of alternate RAM (compared to the size
  of ST-RAM), because executable code always will reside in faster
  memory. ST-RAM will remain as ultra-fast swap space. On the other
  hand, it allows much improved dynamic allocations of ST-RAM buffers
  for device driver modules (e.g. floppy, ACSI, SLM printer, DMA
  sound). The probability that such allocations at module load time
  fail is drastically reduced.

ST-RAM statistics in /proc
CONFIG_STRAM_PROC
  Say Y here to report ST-RAM usage statistics in /proc/stram.  See
  the help for CONFIG_STRAM_SWAP for discussion of ST-RAM and its
  uses.

Atari ACSI support
CONFIG_ATARI_ACSI
  This enables support for the Atari ACSI interface. The driver
  supports hard disks and CD-ROMs, which have 512-byte sectors, or can
  be switched to that mode. Due to the ACSI command format, only disks
  up to 1 GB are supported. Special support for certain ACSI to SCSI
  adapters, which could relax that, isn't included yet. The ACSI
  driver is also the basis for certain other drivers for devices
  attached to the ACSI bus: Atari SLM laser printer, BioNet-100
  Ethernet, and PAMsNet Ethernet. If you want to use one of these
  devices, you need ACSI support, too.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called acsi.o.

Probe all LUNs on each ACSI device
CONFIG_ACSI_MULTI_LUN
  If you have a ACSI device that supports more than one LUN (Logical
  Unit Number), e.g. a CD jukebox, you should say Y here so that all
  will be found by the ACSI driver. An ACSI device with multiple LUNs
  acts logically like multiple ACSI devices. The vast majority of ACSI
  devices have only one LUN, and so most people can say N here and
  should in fact do so, because it is safer.

Atari SLM laser printer support
CONFIG_ATARI_SLM
  If you have an Atari SLM laser printer, say Y to include support for
  it in the kernel. Otherwise, say N. This driver is also available as
  a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the
  running kernel whenever you want). The module will be called
  acsi_slm.o. Be warned: the driver needs much ST-RAM and can cause
  problems due to that fact!

A3000 WD33C93A support
CONFIG_A3000_SCSI
  If you have an Amiga 3000 and have SCSI devices connected to the
  built-in SCSI controller, say Y. Otherwise, say N. This driver is
  also available as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and
  removed from the running kernel whenever you want). The module is
  called wd33c93.o. If you want to compile it as a module, say M here
  and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

A2091 WD33C93A support
CONFIG_A2091_SCSI
  If you have a Commodore A2091 SCSI controller, say Y. Otherwise,
  say N. This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can
  be inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). The module is called wd33c93.o. If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

GVP Series II WD33C93A support
CONFIG_GVP11_SCSI
  If you have a Great Valley Products Series II SCSI controller,
  answer Y. Also say Y if you have a later model of GVP SCSI
  controller (such as the GVP A4008 or a Combo board). Otherwise,
  answer N. This driver does NOT work for the T-Rex series of
  accelerators from TekMagic and GVP-M.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). The module will be called gvp11.o. If you want to compile it
  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

CyberStorm SCSI support
CONFIG_CYBERSTORM_SCSI
  If you have an Amiga with an original (MkI) Phase5 Cyberstorm
  accelerator board and the optional Cyberstorm SCSI controller,
  answer Y. Otherwise, say N.

CyberStorm II SCSI support
CONFIG_CYBERSTORMII_SCSI
  If you have an Amiga with a Phase5 Cyberstorm MkII accelerator board
  and the optional Cyberstorm SCSI controller, say Y. Otherwise,
  answer N.

Blizzard 2060 SCSI support
CONFIG_BLZ2060_SCSI
  If you have an Amiga with a Phase5 Blizzard 2060 accelerator board
  and want to use the onboard SCSI controller, say Y. Otherwise,
  answer N.

Blizzard 1230IV/1260 SCSI support
CONFIG_BLZ1230_SCSI
  If you have an Amiga 1200 with a Phase5 Blizzard 1230IV or Blizzard
  1260 accelerator, and the optional SCSI module, say Y. Otherwise,
  say N.

Blizzard PowerUP 603e+ SCSI support
CONFIG_BLZ603EPLUS_SCSI
  If you have an Amiga 1200 with a Phase5 Blizzard PowerUP 603e+
  accelerator, say Y. Otherwise, say N.

Fastlane SCSI support
CONFIG_FASTLANE_SCSI
  If you have the Phase5 Fastlane Z3 SCSI controller, or plan to use
  one in the near future, say Y to this question. Otherwise, say N.

BSC Oktagon SCSI support
CONFIG_OKTAGON_SCSI
  If you have the BSC Oktagon SCSI disk controller for the Amiga, say
  Y to this question.  If you're in doubt about whether you have one,
  see the picture at
  <http://amiga.multigraph.com/photos/oktagon.html>.

Atari native SCSI support
CONFIG_ATARI_SCSI
  If you have an Atari with built-in NCR5380 SCSI controller (TT,
  Falcon, ...) say Y to get it supported. Of course also, if you have
  a compatible SCSI controller (e.g. for Medusa).  This driver is also
  available as a module ( = code which can be inserted in and removed
  from the running kernel whenever you want).  The module is called
  atari_scsi.o.  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and
  read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  This driver supports both
  styles of NCR integration into the system: the TT style (separate
  DMA), and the Falcon style (via ST-DMA, replacing ACSI).  It does
  NOT support other schemes, like in the Hades (without DMA).

Long delays for Toshiba CD-ROMs
CONFIG_ATARI_SCSI_TOSHIBA_DELAY
  This option increases the delay after a SCSI arbitration to
  accommodate some flaky Toshiba CD-ROM drives. Say Y if you intend to
  use a Toshiba CD-ROM drive; otherwise, the option is not needed and
  would impact performance a bit, so say N.

Reset SCSI-devices at boottime
CONFIG_ATARI_SCSI_RESET_BOOT
  Reset the devices on your Atari whenever it boots.  This makes the
  boot process fractionally longer but may assist recovery from errors
  that leave the devices with SCSI operations partway completed.

Hades SCSI DMA emulator
CONFIG_TT_DMA_EMUL
  This option enables code which emulates the TT SCSI DMA chip on the
  Hades. This increases the SCSI transfer rates at least ten times
  compared to PIO transfers.

Sun3x ESP SCSI
CONFIG_SUN3X_ESP
  This option will enable support for the ESP SCSI controller found
  onboard the Sun 3/80.

Ariadne support
CONFIG_ARIADNE
  If you have a Village Tronic Ariadne Ethernet adapter, say Y.
  Otherwise, say N.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). The module is called ariadne.o. If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Ariadne II and X-Surf support
CONFIG_ARIADNE2
  This driver is for the Village Tronic Ariadne II and the Individual
  Computers X-Surf Ethernet cards. If you have such a card, say Y.
  Otherwise, say N.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called ariadne2.o. If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

A2065 support
CONFIG_A2065
  If you have a Commodore A2065 Ethernet adapter, say Y. Otherwise,
  say N.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). The module is called a2065.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Hydra support
CONFIG_HYDRA
  If you have a Hydra Ethernet adapter, say Y. Otherwise, say N.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). The module is called hydra.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Sun3 NCR5380 SCSI
CONFIG_SUN3_SCSI
  This option will enable support for the OBIO (onboard io) NCR5380
  SCSI controller found in the Sun 3/50 and 3/60.  Note that this
  driver does not provide support for VME SCSI boards.
  General Linux information on the Sun 3 series (now discontinued)
  is at <http://www.angelfire.com/ca2/tech68k/sun3.html>.

PCMCIA NE2000 and compatibles support
CONFIG_APNE
  If you have a PCMCIA NE2000 compatible adapter, say Y.  Otherwise,
  say N.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you
  want). The module is called apne.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Atari Lance support
CONFIG_ATARILANCE
  Say Y to include support for several Atari Ethernet adapters based
  on the AMD Lance chipset: RieblCard (with or without battery), or
  PAMCard VME (also the version by Rhotron, with different addresses).

BioNet-100 support
CONFIG_ATARI_BIONET
  Say Y to include support for BioData's BioNet-100 Ethernet adapter
  for the ACSI port. The driver works (has to work...) with a polled
  I/O scheme, so it's rather slow :-(

PAMsNet support
CONFIG_ATARI_PAMSNET
  Say Y to include support for the PAMsNet Ethernet adapter for the
  ACSI port ("ACSI node"). The driver works (has to work...) with a
  polled I/O scheme, so it's rather slow :-(

Amiga mouse support
CONFIG_AMIGAMOUSE
  If you want to be able to use an Amiga mouse in Linux, say Y.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module is called amigamouse.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Atari mouse support
CONFIG_ATARIMOUSE
  If you want to be able to use an Atari mouse in Linux, say Y.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module is called atarimouse.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Atari MFP serial support
CONFIG_ATARI_MFPSER
  If you like to use the MFP serial ports ("Modem1", "Serial1") under
  Linux, say Y. The driver equally supports all kinds of MFP serial
  ports and automatically detects whether Serial1 is available.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  Note for Falcon users: You also have an MFP port, it's just not
  wired to the outside... But you could use the port under Linux.

Atari SCC serial support
CONFIG_ATARI_SCC
  If you have serial ports based on a Zilog SCC chip (Modem2, Serial2,
  LAN) and like to use them under Linux, say Y. All built-in SCC's are
  supported (TT, MegaSTE, Falcon), and also the ST-ESCC. If you have
  two connectors for channel A (Serial2 and LAN), they are visible as
  two separate devices.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Atari SCC serial DMA support
CONFIG_ATARI_SCC_DMA
  This enables DMA support for receiving data on channel A of the SCC.
  If you have a TT you may say Y here and read
  drivers/char/atari_SCC.README. All other users should say N here,
  because only the TT has SCC-DMA, even if your machine keeps claiming
  so at boot time.

Atari MIDI serial support
CONFIG_ATARI_MIDI
  If you want to use your Atari's MIDI port in Linux, say Y.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be

  want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Atari DSP56k Digital Signal Processor support
CONFIG_ATARI_DSP56K
  If you want to be able to use the DSP56001 in Falcons, say Y. This
  driver is still experimental, and if you don't know what it is, or
  if you don't have this processor, just say N.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Support for early boot text console
CONFIG_BOOTX_TEXT
  Say Y here to see progress messages from the boot firmware in text
  mode. Requires either BootX or Open Firmware.

Amiga builtin serial support
CONFIG_AMIGA_BUILTIN_SERIAL
  If you want to use your Amiga's built-in serial port in Linux,
  answer Y.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be

  HP300 machine, say Y here.

DIO bus support
CONFIG_DIO
  Say Y here to enable support for the "DIO" expansion bus used in
  HP300 machines. If you are using such a system you almost certainly
  want this.

# Choice: ppctype
Processor Type
CONFIG_6xx
  There are four types of PowerPC chips supported.  The more common
  types (601, 603, 604, 740, 750, 7400), the Motorola embedded
  versions (821, 823, 850, 855, 860, 8260), the IBM embedded versions
  (403 and 405) and the high end 64 bit Power processors (Power 3,
  Power 4).  Unless you are building a kernel for one of the embedded
  processor systems, or a 64 bit IBM RS/6000, choose 6xx.  Note that
  the kernel runs in 32-bit mode even on 64-bit chips.  Also note that
  because the 82xx family has a 603e core, specific support for that
  chipset is asked later on.

Motorola MPC8260 CPM support
CONFIG_8260
  The MPC8260 CPM (Communications Processor Module) is a typical
  embedded CPU made by Motorola.  Selecting this option means that
  you wish to build a kernel for a machine with specifically an 8260
  for a CPU.

  If in doubt, say N.

# Choice: ppc4xxtype
Oak
CONFIG_OAK
  Select Oak if you have an IBM 403GCX "Oak" Evaluation Board.

  Select Walnut if you have an IBM 405GP "Walnut" Evaluation Board.

  More information on these boards is available at:
  <http://www.chips.ibm.com/products/powerpc/tools/evk_pn.html#GCX>.

Walnut
CONFIG_WALNUT
  Select Walnut if you have an IBM 405GP "Walnut" Evaluation Board.

Workarounds for PPC601 bugs
CONFIG_PPC601_SYNC_FIX
  Some versions of the PPC601 (the first PowerPC chip) have bugs which
  mean that extra synchronization instructions are required near
  certain instructions, typically those that make major changes to the
  CPU state.  These extra instructions reduce performance slightly.
  If you say N here, these extra instructions will not be included,
  resulting in a kernel which will run faster but may not run at all
  on some systems with the PPC601 chip.

  If in doubt, say Y here.

8xx Cache (Copy-Back or Writethrough)
CONFIG_8xx_COPYBACK
  Saying Y here will cause the cache on an MPC8xx processor to be used
  in Copy-Back mode.  If you say N here, it is used in Writethrough
  mode.

  If in doubt, say Y here.

MPC860 (Pre Rev. C) CPU6 Silicon Errata
CONFIG_8xx_CPU6
  MPC860 CPUs, prior to Rev C have some bugs in the silicon, which
  require workarounds for Linux (and most other OSes to work).  If you
  get a BUG() very early in boot, this might fix the problem.  For
  more details read the document entitled "MPC860 Family Device Errata
  Reference" on Motorola's website.  This option also incurs a
  performance hit.

  If in doubt, say N here.

MPC8xx direct IDE support on PCMCIA port
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_MPC8xx_IDE
  This option provides support for IDE on Motorola MPC8xx Systems.
  Please see 'Type of MPC8xx IDE interface' for details.

  If unsure, say N.

# Choice: mpc8xxtype
Type of MPC8xx IDE interface
CONFIG_IDE_8xx_PCCARD
  Select how the IDE devices are connected to the MPC8xx system:

  8xx_PCCARD uses the 8xx internal PCMCIA interface in combination
             with a PC Card (e.g. ARGOSY portable Hard Disk Adapter),
             ATA PC Card HDDs or ATA PC Flash Cards (example: TQM8xxL
             systems)

  8xx_DIRECT is used for directly connected IDE devices using the 8xx
             internal PCMCIA interface (example: IVMS8 systems)

  EXT_DIRECT is used for IDE devices directly connected to the 8xx
             bus using some glue logic, but _not_ the 8xx internal
             PCMCIA interface (example: IDIF860 systems)

Use SMC2 for UART
CONFIG_SMC2_UART
  If you would like to use SMC2 as a serial port, say Y here.

  If in doubt, say Y here.

Use SMC2 for Console
CONFIG_CONS_SMC2
  If you are going to have a serial console on your device and are
  using SMC2 for your serial port, say Y here, else say N.

Use the alternate SMC2 I/O
CONFIG_ALTSMC2
  If you have an MPC823 or MPC850 and would like to use the alternate
  SMC2 for I/O, say Y here.

  If in doubt, say N here.

Enable SCC2 and SCC3 for UART
CONFIG_USE_SCC_IO
  If your MPC8xx board has other SCC ports that you would like to use
  for for a serial port, say Y here.

  If in doubt, say N here.

# Choice: ppc6xxtype
Machine Type
CONFIG_ALL_PPC
  Linux currently supports several different kinds of PowerPC-based
  machines: Apple Power Macintoshes and clones (such as the Motorola
  Starmax series), PReP (PowerPC Reference Platform) machines (such
  as the Motorola PowerStacks, Motorola cPCI/VME embedded systems,
  and some IBM RS/6000 systems), CHRP (Common Hardware Reference
  Platform), and several embedded PowerPC systems containing 4xx, 6xx,
  7xx, 8xx, 74xx, and 82xx processors.  Currently, the default option
  is to build a kernel which works on the first three.

  Select PowerMac/PReP/MTX/CHRP if configuring for any of the above.

  Select Gemini if configuring for a Synergy Microsystems' Gemini
  series Single Board Computer.  More information is available at:
  <http://www.synergymicro.com/PressRel/97_10_15.html>.

  Select APUS if configuring for a PowerUP Amiga.  More information is
  available at: <http://linux-apus.sourceforge.net/>.

  Note that Total Impact briQ is handled as a CHRP machine.

Synergy-Gemini
CONFIG_GEMINI
  Select Gemini if configuring for a Synergy Microsystems' Gemini
  series Single Board Computer.  More information is available at:
  <http://www.synergymicro.com/PressRel/97_10_15.html>.

Amiga-Apus
CONFIG_APUS
  Select APUS if configuring for a PowerUP Amiga.
  More information is available at:
  <http://linux-apus.sourceforge.net/>.

AltiVec kernel support
CONFIG_ALTIVEC
  This option enables kernel support for the Altivec extensions to the
  PowerPC processor. The kernel currently supports saving and restoring
  altivec registers, and turning on the 'altivec enable' bit so user
  processes can execute altivec instructions.

  This option is only usefully if you have a processor that supports
  altivec (G4, otherwise known as 74xx series), but does not have
  any affect on a non-altivec cpu (it does, however add code to the
  kernel).

  If in doubt, say Y here.

Thermal Management Support
CONFIG_TAU
  G3 and G4 processors have an on-chip temperature sensor called the
  'Thermal Assist Unit (TAU)', which, in theory, can measure the on-die
  temperature within 2-4 degrees Celsius. This option shows the current
  on-die temperature in /proc/cpuinfo if the cpu supports it.

  Unfortunately, on some chip revisions, this sensor is very inaccurate
  and in some cases, does not work at all, so don't assume the cpu
  temp is actually what /proc/cpuinfo says it is.

Interrupt driven TAU driver
CONFIG_TAU_INT
  The TAU supports an interrupt driven mode which causes an interrupt
  whenever the temperature goes out of range. This is the fastest way
  to get notified the temp has exceeded a range. With this option off,
  a timer is used to re-check the temperature periodically.

  However, on some cpus it appears that the TAU interrupt hardware
  is buggy and can cause a situation which would lead unexplained hard
  lockups.

  Unless you are extending the TAU driver, or enjoy kernel/hardware
  debugging, leave this option off.

Average high and low temp
CONFIG_TAU_AVERAGE
  The TAU hardware can compare the temperature to an upper and lower bound.
  The default behaviour is to show both the upper and lower bound in
  /proc/cpuinfo. If the range is large, the temperature is either changing
  a lot, or the TAU hardware is broken (likely on some G4's). If the range
  is small (around 4 degrees), the temperature is relatively stable.

Power management support for PowerBooks
CONFIG_PMAC_PBOOK
  This provides support for putting a PowerBook to sleep; it also
  enables media bay support.  Power management works on the
  PB2400/3400/3500, Wallstreet, Lombard, and Bronze PowerBook G3. You
  must get the power management daemon, pmud, to make it work and you
  must have the /dev/pmu device (see the pmud README).

  Get pmud from <ftp://ftp.samba.org/pub/ppclinux/pmud/>.

  If you have a PowerBook, you should say Y.

  You may also want to compile the dma sound driver as a module and
  have it autoloaded. The act of removing the module shuts down the
  sound hardware for more power savings.

APM emulation
CONFIG_PMAC_APM_EMU
  This driver provides an emulated /dev/apm_bios and /proc/apm. The
  first one is mostly intended for XFree to sleep & wakeup properly,
  the second ones provides some battery informations to allow existing
  APM utilities to work. It provides less useful informations than
  tools specifically designed for PowerBooks or /proc/pmu/battery_x

Backlight control for LCD screens
CONFIG_PMAC_BACKLIGHT
  Say Y here to build in code to manage the LCD backlight on a
  Macintosh PowerBook.  With this code, the backlight will be turned
  on and off appropriately on power-management and lid-open/lid-closed
  events; also, the PowerBook button device will be enabled so you can
  change the screen brightness.

# Choice: ppc8xxtype

ADB raw keycode support
CONFIG_MAC_ADBKEYCODES
  This provides support for sending raw ADB keycodes to console
  devices.  This is the default up to 2.4.0, but in future this may be
  phased out in favor of generic Linux keycodes.  If you say Y here,
  you can dynamically switch via the
      /proc/sys/dev/mac_hid/keyboard_sends_linux_keycodes
  sysctl and with the "keyboard_sends_linux_keycodes=" kernel
  argument.

  If unsure, say Y here.

I2C/SPI Microcode Patch
CONFIG_UCODE_PATCH
  Motorola releases microcode updates for their 8xx CPM modules.  The
  microcode update file has updates for IIC, SMC and USB.  Currently only
  the USB update is available by default, if the MPC8xx USB option is
  enabled.  If in doubt, say 'N' here.

Mouse button 2+3 emulation support
CONFIG_MAC_EMUMOUSEBTN
  This provides generic support for emulating the 2nd and 3rd mouse
  button with keypresses.  If you say Y here, the emulation is still
  disabled by default.  The emulation is controlled by these sysctl
  entries:
      /proc/sys/dev/mac_hid/mouse_button_emulation
      /proc/sys/dev/mac_hid/mouse_button2_keycode
      /proc/sys/dev/mac_hid/mouse_button3_keycode

Enhanced Real Time Clock Support (/dev/rtc)
CONFIG_PPC_RTC
  If you say Y here and create a character special file /dev/rtc with
  major number 10 and minor number 135 using mknod ("man mknod"), you
  will get access to the real time clock (or hardware clock) built
  into your computer.

  If unsure, say Y here.

Support for Open Firmware device tree in /proc
CONFIG_PROC_DEVICETREE
  This option adds a device-tree directory under /proc which contains
  an image of the device tree that the kernel copies from Open
  Firmware. If unsure, say Y here.

RTAS (RunTime Abstraction Services) in /proc
CONFIG_PPC_RTAS
  When you use this option, you will be able to use RTAS from
  userspace.

  RTAS stands for RunTime Abstraction Services and should
  provide a portable way to access and set system information. This is
  commonly used on RS/6000 (pSeries) computers.

  You can access RTAS via the special proc file system entry rtas.
  Don't confuse this rtas entry with the one in /proc/device-tree/rtas
  which is readonly.

  If you don't know if you can use RTAS look into
  /proc/device-tree/rtas. If there are some entries, it is very likely
  that you will be able to use RTAS.

  You can do cool things with rtas. To print out information about
  various sensors in the system, just do a

    $ cat /proc/rtas/sensors

  or if you power off your machine at night but want it running when
  you enter your office at 7:45 am, do a

    # date -d 'tomorrow 7:30' +%s > /proc/rtas/poweron

  and shutdown.

  If unsure, say Y.

MESH (Power Mac internal SCSI) support
CONFIG_SCSI_MESH
  Many Power Macintoshes and clones have a MESH (Macintosh Enhanced
  SCSI Hardware) SCSI bus adaptor (the 7200 doesn't, but all of the
  other Power Macintoshes do). Say Y to include support for this SCSI
  adaptor. This driver is also available as a module called mesh.o
  ( = code which can be inserted in and removed from the running
  kernel whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module,
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Maximum synchronous transfer rate (MB/s) (0 = async)
CONFIG_SCSI_MESH_SYNC_RATE
  On Power Macintoshes (and clones) where the MESH SCSI bus adaptor
  drives a bus which is entirely internal to the machine (such as the
  7500, 7600, 8500, etc.), the MESH is capable of synchronous
  operation at up to 10 MB/s. On machines where the SCSI bus
  controlled by the MESH can have external devices connected, it is
  usually rated at 5 MB/s. 5 is a safe value here unless you know the
  MESH SCSI bus is internal only; in that case you can say 10. Say 0
  to disable synchronous operation.

53C94 (Power Mac external SCSI) support
CONFIG_SCSI_MAC53C94
  On Power Macintoshes (and clones) with two SCSI buses, the external
  SCSI bus is usually controlled by a 53C94 SCSI bus adaptor. Older
  machines which only have one SCSI bus, such as the 7200, also use
  the 53C94. Say Y to include support for the 53C94.

  This driver is also available as a module called mac53c94.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  motherboard will usually use a MACE (Medium Access Control for
  Ethernet) interface. Say Y to include support for the MACE chip.

  This driver is also available as a module called mace.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Use AAUI port instead of TP by default
CONFIG_MACE_AAUI_PORT
  Some Apple machines (notably the Apple Network Server) which use the
  MACE ethernet chip have an Apple AUI port (small 15-pin connector),
  instead of an 8-pin RJ45 connector for twisted-pair ethernet.  Say
  Y here if you have such a machine.  If unsure, say N.
  The driver will default to AAUI on ANS anyway, and if you use it as
  a module, you can provide the port_aaui=0|1 to force the driver.

BMAC (G3 Ethernet) support
CONFIG_BMAC
  Say Y for support of BMAC Ethernet interfaces. These are used on G3
  computers.

  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

IBM's S/390 architecture
CONFIG_ARCH_S390
  Select this option, if you want to run the Kernel on one of IBM's
  mainframes of the S/390 generation. You should have installed the
  s390-compiler released by IBM (based on gcc-2.95.1) before.

Merge some code into the kernel to make the image IPLable
CONFIG_IPL
  If you want to use the produced kernel to IPL directly from a
  device, you have to merge a bootsector specific to the device
  into the first bytes of the kernel. You will have to select the
  IPL device on another question, that pops up, when you select
  CONFIG_IPL.

IPL from a S/390 tape unit
CONFIG_IPL_TAPE
  Select this option if you want to IPL the image from a Tape.

IPL from a virtual card reader emulated by VM/ESA
CONFIG_IPL_VM
  Select this option if you are running under VM/ESA and want 
  to IPL the image from the emulated card reader.

CONFIG_PFAULT
  Select this option, if you want to use PFAULT pseudo page fault
  handling under VM. If running native or in LPAR, this option
  has no effect. If your VM does not support PFAULT, PAGEEX
  pseudo page fault handling will be used.
  Note that VM 4.2 supports PFAULT but has a bug in its
  implementation that causes some problems.
  Everybody who wants to run Linux under VM != VM4.2 should select
  this option.

CONFIG_SHARED_KERNEL
  Select this option, if you want to share the text segment of the
  Linux kernel between different VM guests. This reduces memory
  usage with lots of guests but greatly increases kernel size.
  You should only select this option if you know what you are
  doing and want to exploit this feature.

Support for IBM-style disk-labels (S/390)
CONFIG_S390_PARTITION
  Enable this option to assure standard IBM labels on the DASDs.
  You must enable it, if you are planning to access DASDs also
  attached to another IBM mainframe operation system (OS/390, 
  VM/ESA, VSE/ESA).

Support for DASD hard disks
CONFIG_DASD
  Enable this option if you want to access DASDs directly utilizing
  S/390s channel subsystem commands. This is necessary for running
  natively on a single image or an LPAR.

Support for ECKD hard disks
CONFIG_DASD_ECKD
  ECKD (Extended Count Key Data) devices are the most commonly used 
  devices on S/390s. You should enable this option unless you are 
  very sure you have no ECKD device.

ECKD demand loading
CONFIG_DASD_AUTO_ECKD
  This option enables demand loading of the ECKD module. 

Support for FBA hard disks

  This option enables demand loading of the FBA module. 

Support for DIAG access to CMS reserved Disks
CONFIG_DASD_DIAG
  Select this option if you want to use CMS reserved Disks under VM
  with the Diagnose250 command.  If you are not running under VM or
  unsure what it is, say "N".

DIAG demand loading
CONFIG_DASD_AUTO_DIAG
  This option enables demand loading of the DIAG module. 

Merge some code into the kernel to make the image IPLable
CONFIG_IPLABLE
  If you want to use the produced kernel to IPL directly from a
  device, you have to merge a bootsector specific to the device
  into the first bytes of the kernel. You will have to select the
  IPL device on another question, that pops up, when you select
  CONFIG_IPLABE.

Console on HWC line mode terminal
CONFIG_HWC_CONSOLE
  Include support for using an IBM HWC line-mode terminal as the Linux
  system console.

Control Program Identification
CONFIG_HWC_CPI
  Allows for Control Program Identification via the HWC interface,
  i.e. provides a mean to pass an OS instance name (system name)
  to the machine.

  This option should only be selected as a module since the
  system name has to be passed as module parameter. The module
  will be called hwc_cpi.o.

S/390 tape device support
CONFIG_S390_TAPE
  Select this option if you want to access channel-attached tape
  devices on IBM S/390 or zSeries.
  If you select this option you will also want to select at
  least one of the tape interface options and one of the tape
  hardware options in order to access a tape device.
  This option is also available as a module. The module will be
  called tape390.o and include all selected interfaces.
  The hardware drivers will be seperate modules.
  If unsure, say "Y".

Support for tape character devices
CONFIG_S390_TAPE_CHAR

  If unsure, say "Y".

Support for tape block devices
CONFIG_S390_TAPE_BLOCK
  Select this option if you want to access your channel-attached tape
  devices using the block device interface.  This interface is similar
  to CD-ROM devices on other platforms.  The tapes can only be
  accessed read-only when using this interface.  Have a look at
  Documentation/s390/TAPE for further information about creating
  volumes for and using this interface.  It is safe to say "Y" here.

Support for 3490 tape hardware

  Select this option if you want to access IBM 3490 magnetic
  tape subsystems and 100% compatibles.
  This option is also available as a module. The module will be
  called tape3490.o. If CONFIG_S390_TAPE is selected as a module,
  this hardware driver cannot be built-in but is only available
  as a module.
  It is safe to say "Y" here.

Support for 3480 tape hardware
CONFIG_S390_TAPE_3480
  Select this option if you want to access IBM 3480 magnetic
  tape subsystems and 100% compatibles.
  This option is also available as a module. The module will be
  called tape3480.o. If CONFIG_S390_TAPE is selected as a module,
  this hardware driver cannot be built-in but is only available
  as a module.
  It is safe to say "Y" here.

CTC device support
CONFIG_CTC
  Select this option if you want to use channel-to-channel networking
  on IBM S/390 or zSeries. This device driver supports real CTC
  coupling using ESCON. It also supports virtual CTCs when running
  under VM. It will use the channel device configuration if this is
  available.  This option is also available as a module which will be
  called ctc.o.  If you do not know what it is, it's safe to say "Y".

XPRAM disk support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_XPRAM
  Select this option if you want to use your expanded storage on S/390
  or zSeries as a disk.  This is useful as a _fast_ swap device if you
  want to access more than 2G of memory when running in 31 bit mode.
  This option is also available as a module which will be called
  xpram.o.  If unsure, say "N".

Fast IRQ handling
CONFIG_FAST_IRQ
  Select this option in order to get the interrupts processed faster
  on your S/390 or zSeries machine.  If selected, after an interrupt
  is processed, the channel subsystem will be asked for other pending
  interrupts which will also be processed before leaving the interrupt
  context.  This speeds up the I/O a lot. Say "Y".

IUCV device support (VM only)
CONFIG_IUCV
  Select this option if you want to use inter-user communication
  vehicle networking under VM or VIF.  This option is also available
  as a module which will be called iucv.o. If unsure, say "Y".

Process warning machine checks
CONFIG_MACHCHK_WARNING
  Select this option if you want the machine check handler on IBM S/390 or 
  zSeries to process warning machine checks (e.g. on power failures). 
  If unsure, say "Y".

Use chscs for Common I/O
CONFIG_CHSC
  Select this option if you want the s390 common I/O layer to use information
  obtained by channel subsystem calls. This will enable Linux to process link
  failures and resource accessibility events. Moreover, if you have procfs
  enabled, you'll be able to toggle chpids logically offline and online. Even
  if you don't understand what this means, you should say "Y".

Kernel support for 31 bit ELF binaries
CONFIG_S390_SUPPORT
  Select this option if you want to enable your system kernel to
  handle system-calls from ELF binaries for 31 bit ESA.  This option
  (and some other stuff like libraries and such) is needed for
  executing 31 bit applications.  It is safe to say "Y".

Channel Device Configuration
CONFIG_CHANDEV
  The channel device layer is a layer to provide a consistent
  interface for configuration & default machine check (devices
  appearing & disappearing) handling on Linux for s/390 & z/Series
  channel devices.

  s/390 & z/Series channel devices include among others

  lcs (the most common ethernet/token ring/fddi standard on
  zSeries)
  ctc/escon hi speed like serial link standard on zSeries
  claw used to talk to cisco routers.
  qeth gigabit ethernet.

  These devices use two channels one read & one write for
  configuration & communication (& a third channel, the data
  channel the case of gigabit ethernet). The motivation
  behind developing this layer was that there was a lot of
  duplicate code among the channel device drivers for
  configuration.

  Also the lcs & ctc drivers tended to fight over
  3088/08's & 3088/1F's which could be either 2216/3172
  channel attached lcs compatible devices or escon/ctc pipes
  had to be configured separately as they couldn't autodetect,
  this is now simplified by doing the configuration in a single
  place (the channel device layer).

  This layer isn't invasive & it is quite okay to use channel
  drivers which don't use the channel device layer in
  conjunction with drivers which do.

  For more info see the chandev manpage usually distributed in
  <file:Documentation/s390/chandev.8> in the Linux source tree.

  supported by this driver, and for further information on the use of
  this driver.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
  cpqarray.o

Show crashed user process info
CONFIG_PROCESS_DEBUG

  handheld computer.  See <http://www.hp.com/jornada/products/720>
  for details.

InHand Electronics OmniMeter
CONFIG_SA1100_OMNIMETER
  Say Y here if you are using the inhand electronics OmniMeter.  See
  <http://www.inhandelectronics.com/html/omni1.html> for details.

Load kernel using Angel Debug Monitor
CONFIG_ANGELBOOT
  Say Y if you plan to load the kernel using Angel, ARM Ltd's target
  debug stub.  If you are not using Angel, you must say N.  It is
  important to get this setting correct.

CDB89712
CONFIG_ARCH_CDB89712
  This is an evaluation board from Cirrus for the CS89712 processor.  The
  board includes 2 serial ports, Ethernet, IRDA, and expansion headers.
  It comes with 16 MB SDRAM and 8 MB flash ROM.

CLPS-711X internal ROM bootstrap
CONFIG_EP72XX_ROM_BOOT
  If you say Y here, your CLPS711x-based kernel will use the bootstrap
  mode memory map instead of the normal memory map.

  Processors derived from the Cirrus CLPS-711X core support two boot modes.
  Normal mode boots from the external memory device at CS0.  Bootstrap mode
  rearranges parts of the memory map, placing an internal 128 byte bootstrap
  ROM at CS0.  This option performs the address map changes required to
  support booting in this mode.

  You almost surely want to say N here.

Math emulation
CONFIG_FPE_NWFPE
  Say Y to include the NWFPE floating point emulator in the kernel.
  This is necessary to run most binaries. Linux does not currently
  support floating point hardware so you need to say Y here even if
  your machine has an FPA or floating point co-processor podule.

  It is also possible to say M to build the emulator as a module
  (nwfpe.o) or indeed to leave it out altogether. However, unless you
  know what you are doing this can easily render your machine
  unbootable. Saying Y is the safe option.

  You may say N here if you are going to load the Acorn FPEmulator
  early in the bootup.

FastFPE math emulation
CONFIG_FPE_FASTFPE
  Say Y here to include the FAST floating point emulator in the kernel.
  This is an experimental much faster emulator which has only 32 bit
  precision for the mantissa.  It does not support any exceptions.
  This makes it very simple, it is approximately 4-8 times faster than
  NWFPE.

  It should be sufficient for most programs.  It is definitely not
  suitable if you do scientific calculations that need double
  precision for iteration formulas that sum up lots of very small
  numbers.  If you do not feel you need a faster FP emulation you
  should better choose NWFPE.

  It is also possible to say M to build the emulator as a module
  (fastfpe.o).  But keep in mind that you should only load the FP
  emulator early in the bootup.  You should never change from NWFPE to
  FASTFPE or vice versa in an active system!

DS1620 thermometer support
CONFIG_DS1620
  Say Y here to include support for the thermal management hardware
  found in the NetWinder. This driver allows the user to control the
  temperature set points and to read the current temperature.

  It is also possible to say M here to build it as a module (ds1620.o)
  It is recommended to be used on a NetWinder, but it is not a
  necessity.

Check for stack overflows
CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW
  This option make do_IRQ() check for enough stack space beeing left.
  This is safe to enable.

Debug high memory support
CONFIG_DEBUG_HIGHMEM
  This options enables addition error checking for high memory systems.
  Disable for production systems.

Verbose kernel error messages
CONFIG_DEBUG_ERRORS
  This option controls verbose debugging information which can be
  printed when the kernel detects an internal error. This debugging
  information is useful to kernel hackers when tracking down problems,
  but mostly meaningless to other people. It's safe to say Y unless
  you are concerned with the code size or don't want to see these
  messages.

Compile kernel with frame pointer
CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER
  If you say Y here, the resulting kernel will be slightly larger and
  slower, but it will give very useful debugging information. If you
  don't debug the kernel, you can say N, but we may not be able to
  solve problems without frame pointers.

Verbose user fault messages
CONFIG_DEBUG_USER
  When a user program crashes due to an exception, the kernel can
  print a brief message explaining what the problem was. This is
  sometimes helpful for debugging but serves no purpose on a
  production system. Most people should say N here.

Include gdb debugging information in kernel binary
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO
  Say Y here to include source-level debugging information in the
  `vmlinux' binary image. This is handy if you want to use gdb or
  addr2line to debug the kernel. It has no impact on the in-memory
  footprint of the running kernel but it can increase the amount of
  time and disk space needed for compilation of the kernel. If in
  doubt say N.

Kernel low-level debugging functions
CONFIG_DEBUG_LL
  Say Y here to include definitions of printascii, printchar, printhex
  in the kernel.  This is helpful if you are debugging code that
  executes before the console is initialized.

Kernel low-level debugging messages via footbridge serial port
CONFIG_DEBUG_DC21285_PORT
  Say Y here if you want the debug print routines to direct their
  output to the serial port in the DC21285 (Footbridge). Saying N
  will cause the debug messages to appear on the first 16550
  serial port.

Kernel low-level debugging messages via UART2
CONFIG_DEBUG_CLPS711X_UART2
  Say Y here if you want the debug print routines to direct their
  output to the second serial port on these devices.  Saying N will
  cause the debug messages to appear on the first serial port.

Disable pgtable cache
CONFIG_NO_PGT_CACHE
  Normally the kernel maintains a `quicklist' of preallocated
  pagetable structures in order to increase performance. On machines
  with very few pages this may however be a loss. Say Y here to
  disable the pgtable cache.

RISC OS personality
CONFIG_ARTHUR
  Say Y here to include the kernel code necessary if you want to run
  Acorn RISC OS/Arthur binaries under Linux. This code is still very
  experimental; if this sounds frightening, say N and sleep in peace.
  You can also say M here to compile this support as a module (which
  will be called arthur.o).

Initial kernel command line
CONFIG_CMDLINE
  On some architectures (EBSA110 and CATS), there is currently no way
  for the boot loader to pass arguments to the kernel. For these
  architectures, you should supply some command-line options at build
  time by entering them here. As a minimum, you should specify the
  memory size and the root device (e.g., mem=64M root=/dev/nfs).

Kernel-mode alignment trap handler
CONFIG_ALIGNMENT_TRAP
  ARM processors can not fetch/store information which is not
  naturally aligned on the bus, i.e., a 4 byte fetch must start at an
  address divisible by 4. On 32-bit ARM processors, these non-aligned
  fetch/store instructions will be emulated in software if you say
  here, which has a severe performance impact. This is necessary for
  correct operation of some network protocols. With an IP-only
  configuration it is safe to say N, otherwise say Y.

DC21285 serial port support
CONFIG_SERIAL_21285
  If you have a machine based on a 21285 (Footbridge) StrongARM(R)/
  PCI bridge you can enable its onboard serial port by enabling this
  option. The device has major ID 4, minor 64.

Console on DC21285 serial port
CONFIG_SERIAL_21285_CONSOLE
  If you have enabled the serial port on the 21285 footbridge you can
  make it the console by answering Y to this option.

  * If you read this note from the configurator, please contact *
  * the Configure.help maintainers.                             *
  The 21285 Footbridge chip can operate in either `host mode' or
  `add-in' mode.  Say Y if your 21285 is in host mode, and therefore
  is the configuration master, otherwise say N. This must not be
  set to Y if the card is used in 'add-in' mode.

MFM hard disk support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_MFM
  Support the MFM hard drives on the Acorn Archimedes both
  on-board the A4x0 motherboards and via the Acorn MFM modules.
  Drives up to 64MB are supported. If you haven't got one of these
  machines or drives just say N.

Old Archimedes floppy (1772) support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_FD1772
  Support the floppy drive on the Acorn Archimedes (A300, A4x0, A540,
  R140 and R260) series of computers; it supports only 720K floppies
  at the moment. If you don't have one of these machines just answer
  N.

Autodetect hard drive geometry
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_MFM_AUTODETECT
  If you answer Y, the MFM code will attempt to automatically detect
  the cylinders/heads/sectors count on your hard drive. WARNING: This
  sometimes doesn't work and it also does some dodgy stuff which
  potentially might damage your drive.

NetWinder /dev/flash support
CONFIG_NWFLASH
  If you say Y here and create a character device /dev/flash with
  major 10 and minor 160 you can manipulate the flash ROM containing
  the NetWinder firmware. Be careful as accidentally overwriting the
  flash contents can render your computer unbootable. On no account
  allow random users access to this device. :-)

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called nwflash.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If you're not sure, say N.

SRM environment variables in procfs
CONFIG_SRM_ENV
  If you enable this option, a subdirectory inside /proc called
  /proc/srm_environment will give you access to the all important
  SRM environment variables (those which have a name) and also
  to all others (by their internal number).

  SRM is something like a BIOS for Alpha machines. There are some
  other such BIOSes, like AlphaBIOS, which this driver cannot
  support (hey, that's not SRM!).

  Despite the fact that this driver doesn't work on all Alphas (but
  only on those which have SRM as their firmware), it's save to
  build it even if your particular machine doesn't know about SRM
  (or if you intend to compile a generic kernel). It will simply
  not create those subdirectory in /proc (and give you some warning,
  of course).

  This driver is also available as a module and will be called
  srm_env.o then.

Footbridge internal watchdog
CONFIG_21285_WATCHDOG
  The Intel Footbridge chip contains a builtin watchdog circuit. Say Y
  here if you wish to use this. Alternatively say M to compile the
  driver as a module, which will be called wdt285.o.

  This driver does not work on all machines. In particular, early CATS
  boards have hardware problems that will cause the machine to simply
  lock up if the watchdog fires.

  "If in doubt, leave it out" - say N.

NetWinder WB83C977 watchdog
CONFIG_977_WATCHDOG
  Say Y here to include support for the WB977 watchdog included in
  NetWinder machines. Alternatively say M to compile the driver as
  a module, which will be called wdt977.o.

  Not sure? It's safe to say N.

IrDA subsystem support
CONFIG_IRDA
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrDA (TM) protocols.
  The Infrared Data Associations (tm) specifies standards for wireless
  infrared communication and is supported by most laptops and PDA's.

  To use Linux support for the IrDA (tm) protocols, you will also need
  some user-space utilities like irattach.  For more information, see
  the file <file:Documentation/networking/irda.txt>.  You also want to
  read the IR-HOWTO, available at
  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

  If you want to exchange bits of data (vCal, vCard) with a PDA, you
  will need to install some OBEX application, such as OpenObex :
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/openobex/>

  This support is also available as a module called irda.o.  If you
  want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

Ultra (connectionless) protocol
CONFIG_IRDA_ULTRA
  Say Y here to support the connectionless Ultra IRDA protocol.
  Ultra allows to exchange data over IrDA with really simple devices
  (watch, beacon) without the overhead of the IrDA protocol (no handshaking,
  no management frames, simple fixed header).
  Ultra is available as a special socket : socket(AF_IRDA, SOCK_DGRAM, 1);

IrDA cache last LSAP
CONFIG_IRDA_CACHE_LAST_LSAP
  Say Y here if you want IrLMP to cache the last LSAP used.  This
  makes sense since most frames will be sent/received on the same
  connection.  Enabling this option will save a hash-lookup per frame.

  If unsure, say Y.

IrDA Fast RRs
CONFIG_IRDA_FAST_RR
  Say Y here is you want IrLAP to send fast RR (Receive Ready) frames
  when acting as a primary station.
  Disabling this option will make latency over IrDA very bad. Enabling
  this option will make the IrDA stack send more packet than strictly
  necessary, thus reduce your battery life (but not that much).

  Fast RR will make IrLAP send out a RR frame immediately when
  receiving a frame if its own transmit queue is currently empty. This
  will give a lot of speed improvement when receiving much data since
  the secondary station will not have to wait the max. turn around
  time (usually 500ms) before it is allowed to transmit the next time.
  If the transmit queue of the secondary is also empty, the primary will
  start backing-off before sending another RR frame, waiting longer
  each time until the back-off reaches the max. turn around time.
  This back-off increase in controlled via
  /proc/sys/net/irda/fast_poll_increase

  If unsure, say Y.

IrDA debugging information
CONFIG_IRDA_DEBUG
  Say Y here if you want the IrDA subsystem to write debug information
  to your syslog. You can change the debug level in
  /proc/sys/net/irda/debug .
  When this option is enabled, the IrDA also perform many extra internal
  verifications which will usually prevent the kernel to crash in case of
  bugs.

  If unsure, say Y (since it makes it easier to find the bugs).

IrLAN protocol
CONFIG_IRLAN
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrLAN protocol.  If
  you want to compile it as a module (irlan.o), say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  IrLAN emulates an Ethernet and
  makes it possible to put up a wireless LAN using infrared beams.

  The IrLAN protocol can be used to talk with infrared access points
  like the HP NetbeamIR, or the ESI JetEye NET.  You can also connect
  to another Linux machine running the IrLAN protocol for ad-hoc
  networking!

IrNET protocol
CONFIG_IRNET
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrNET protocol.  If
  you want to compile it as a module (irnet.o), say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  IrNET is a PPP driver, so you
  will also need a working PPP subsystem (driver, daemon and
  config)...

  IrNET is an alternate way to transfer TCP/IP traffic over IrDA.  It
  uses synchronous PPP over a set of point to point IrDA sockets.  You
  can use it between Linux machine or with W2k.

IrCOMM protocol
CONFIG_IRCOMM
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrCOMM protocol.  If
  you want to compile it as a module (you will get ircomm.o and
  ircomm-tty.o), say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
  IrCOMM implements serial port emulation, and makes it possible to
  use all existing applications that understands TTY's with an
  infrared link.  Thus you should be able to use application like PPP,
  minicom and others.  Enabling this option will create two modules
  called ircomm and ircomm_tty.

IrTTY IrDA Device Driver
CONFIG_IRTTY_SIR
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrTTY line
  discipline.  If you want to compile it as a module (irtty.o), say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  IrTTY makes it
  possible to use Linux's own serial driver for all IrDA ports that
  are 16550 compatible.  Most IrDA chips are 16550 compatible so you
  should probably say Y to this option.  Using IrTTY will however
  limit the speed of the connection to 115200 bps (IrDA SIR mode).

  If unsure, say Y.

IrPORT IrDA serial driver
CONFIG_IRPORT_SIR
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrPORT IrDA device
  driver. If you want to compile it as a module (irport.o), say M here
  and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  IrPORT can be used
  instead of IrTTY and sometimes this can be better.  One example is
  if your IrDA port does not have echo-canceling, which will work OK
  with IrPORT since this driver is working in half-duplex mode only.
  You don't need to use irattach with IrPORT, but you just insert it
  the same way as FIR drivers (insmod irport io=0x3e8 irq=11).  Notice
  that IrPORT is a SIR device driver which means that speed is limited
  to 115200 bps.

  If unsure, say Y.

USB IrDA FIR dongle Device Driver
CONFIG_USB_IRDA
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the USB IrDA FIR Dongle
  device driver.  If you want to compile it as a module (irda-usb.o),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  IrDA-USB
  support the various IrDA USB dongles available and most of their
  peculiarities.  Those dongles plug in the USB port of your computer,
  are plug and play, and support SIR and FIR (4Mbps) speeds.  On the
  other hand, those dongles tend to be less efficient than a FIR
  chipset.

  Please note that the driver is still experimental.  And of course,
  you will need both USB and IrDA support in your kernel...

Datafab MDCFE-B Compact Flash Reader support
CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_DATAFAB
  This option enables a sub-driver of the USB Mass Storage driver.  These
  sub-drivers are considered experimental, and should only be used by very
  brave people.  System crashes and other bad things are likely to occur if
  you use this driver.  If in doubt, select N.

HP CD-Writer 82xx support
CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_HP8200e
  This option enables a sub-driver of the USB Mass Storage driver.  These
  sub-drivers are considered experimental, and should only be used by very
  brave people.  System crashes and other bad things are likely to occur if
  you use this driver.  If in doubt, select N.

Lexar Jumpshot Compact Flash Reader
CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_JUMPSHOT       
  This option enables a sub-driver of the USB Mass Storage driver.  These
  sub-drivers are considered experimental, and should only be used by very
  brave people.  System crashes and other bad things are likely to occur if
  you use this driver.  If in doubt, select N.

Winbond W83977AF IrDA Device Driver
CONFIG_WINBOND_FIR
  Say Y here if you want to build IrDA support for the Winbond
  W83977AF super-io chipset.  This driver should be used for the IrDA
  chipset in the Corel NetWinder.  The driver supports SIR, MIR and
  FIR (4Mbps) speeds.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  w83977af_ir.o.

CONFIG_NSC_FIR
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the NSC PC87108 and
  PC87338 IrDA chipsets.  This driver supports SIR,
  MIR and FIR (4Mbps) speeds.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
  nsc-ircc.o.

National Semiconductor DP83820 support
CONFIG_NS83820
  This is a driver for the National Semiconductor DP83820 series
  of gigabit ethernet MACs.  Cards using this chipset include:

        SMC 9452TX          SMC SMC9462TX       
        D-Link DGE-500T     PureData PDP8023Z-TG
        SOHO-GA2000T        SOHO-GA2500T.
        NetGear GA621

  This driver supports the use of zero copy on tx, checksum 
  validation on rx, and 64 bit addressing.

  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called ns83820.o.

Toshiba Type-O IR Port device driver
CONFIG_TOSHIBA_FIR
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the Toshiba Type-O IR
  chipset.  This chipset is used by the Toshiba Libretto 100CT, and

  Say Y here if you want to build support for the SMC Infrared
  Communications Controller.  It is used in the Fujitsu Lifebook 635t
  and Sony PCG-505TX.  If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be
  called smc-ircc.o.

ALi M5123 FIR controller driver
CONFIG_ALI_FIR

  Controller.  The ALi M5123 FIR Controller is embedded in ALi M1543C,
  M1535, M1535D, M1535+, M1535D Sourth Bridge.  This driver supports
  SIR, MIR and FIR (4Mbps) speeds.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called

  Say Y here if you have an infrared device that connects to your
  computer's serial port. These devices are called dongles. Then say Y
  or M to the driver for your particular dongle below.

  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
  the questions about serial dongles.

ESI JetEye PC dongle
CONFIG_ESI_DONGLE
  Say Y here if you want to build support for the Extended Systems
  JetEye PC dongle.  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here

  board.  Boards currently supported include Motorola boards MVME147,
  MVME162, MVME166, MVME167, MVME172, and MVME177.  BVME4000 and
  BVME6000 boards from BVM Ltd are also supported.

MVME147 support
CONFIG_MVME147
  Say Y to include support for early Motorola VME boards.  This will
  build a kernel which can run on MVME147 single-board computers.  If
  you select this option you will have to select the appropriate
  drivers for SCSI, Ethernet and serial ports later on.

MVME162, 166 and 167 support
CONFIG_MVME16x
  Say Y to include support for Motorola VME boards.  This will build a
  kernel which can run on MVME162, MVME166, MVME167, MVME172, and
  MVME177 boards.  If you select this option you will have to select
  the appropriate drivers for SCSI, Ethernet and serial ports later
  on.

BVME4000 and BVME6000 support
CONFIG_BVME6000
  Say Y to include support for VME boards from BVM Ltd.  This will

  drivers for SCSI, Ethernet and serial ports later on.

Use write-through caching for 68060 supervisor accesses
CONFIG_060_WRITETHROUGH
  The 68060 generally uses copyback caching of recently accessed data.
  Copyback caching means that memory writes will be held in an on-chip
  cache and only written back to memory some time later.  Saying Y
  here will force supervisor (kernel) accesses to use writethrough
  caching.  Writethrough caching means that data is written to memory
  straight away, so that cache and memory data always agree.
  Writethrough caching is less efficient, but is needed for some
  drivers on 68060 based systems where the 68060 bus snooping signal
  is hardwired on.  The 53c710 SCSI driver is known to suffer from
  this problem.

  This is the driver for the 7-segment display and LED present on
  Sun Microsystems CompactPCI models CP1400 and CP1500.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called display7seg.o. If you want to compile it
  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If you do not have a CompactPCI model CP1400 or CP1500, or

  This is a bitmask with information about what bits on PA that
  are used for buttons.
  Most products has a so called TEST button on PA1, if that's true
  use 02 here.
  Use 00 if there are no buttons on PA.
  If the bitmask is <> 00 a button driver will be included in the gpio
  driver. Etrax general I/O support must be enabled.

  can change the value on using ioctl's.
  Bit set = changeable.
  You probably want 00 here.

Kernel debugger (kgdb)
CONFIG_ETRAX_KGDB
  The CRIS version of gdb can be used to remotely debug a running
  Linux kernel via the serial debug port.  Provided you have gdb-cris
  installed, run gdb-cris vmlinux, then type

  (gdb) set remotebaud 115200           <- kgdb uses 115200 as default
  (gdb) target remote /dev/ttyS0        <- maybe you use another port

  This should connect you to your booted kernel (or boot it now if you
  didn't before).  The kernel halts when it boots, waiting for gdb if
  this option is turned on!

Etrax bus waitstates
CONFIG_ETRAX_DEF_R_WAITSTATES
  Waitstates for SRAM, Flash and peripherals (not DRAM).  95f8 is a
  good choice for most Axis products...

Etrax bus configuration
CONFIG_ETRAX_DEF_R_BUS_CONFIG
  Assorted bits controlling write mode, DMA burst length etc.  104 is
  a good choice for most Axis products...

Etrax SDRAM configuration
CONFIG_ETRAX_SDRAM
  Enable this if you use SDRAM chips and configure
  R_SDRAM_CONFIG and R_SDRAM_TIMING as well.

DRAM size (dec, in MB)
CONFIG_ETRAX_DEF_R_DRAM_CONFIG
  The R_DRAM_CONFIG register specifies everything on how the DRAM
  chips in the system are connected to the Etrax CPU.  This is
  different depending on the manufacturer, chip type and number of
  chips.  So this value often needs to be different for each Axis
  product.

Etrax DRAM timing
CONFIG_ETRAX_DEF_R_DRAM_TIMING
  Different DRAM chips have different speeds.  Current Axis products
  use 50ns DRAM chips which can use the timing: 5611.

Etrax SDRAM configuration
CONFIG_ETRAX_DEF_R_SDRAM_CONFIG
  The R_SDRAM_CONFIG register specifies everything on how the SDRAM
  chips in the system are connected to the Etrax CPU.  This is
  different depending on the manufacturer, chip type and number of
  chips.  So this value often needs to be different for each Axis
  product.

Etrax SDRAM timing
CONFIG_ETRAX_DEF_R_SDRAM_TIMING
  Different SDRAM chips have different timing.

Etrax General port A direction
CONFIG_ETRAX_DEF_R_PORT_PA_DIR
  Configures the direction of general port A bits.  1 is out, 0 is in.
  This is often totally different depending on the product used.
  There are some guidelines though - if you know that only LED's are
  connected to port PA, then they are usually connected to bits 2-4
  and you can therefore use 1c.  On other boards which don't have the
  LED's at the general ports, these bits are used for all kinds of
  stuff.  If you don't know what to use, it is always safe to put all
  as inputs, although floating inputs isn't good.

Etrax General port A data
CONFIG_ETRAX_DEF_R_PORT_PA_DATA
  Configures the initial data for the general port A bits.  Most
  products should use 00 here.

Etrax General port B config
CONFIG_ETRAX_DEF_R_PORT_PB_CONFIG
  Configures the type of the general port B bits.  1 is chip select,
  0 is port.  Most products should use 00 here.

Etrax General port B direction
CONFIG_ETRAX_DEF_R_PORT_PB_DIR
  Configures the direction of general port B bits. 1 is out, 0 is in.
  This is often totally different depending on the product used.  Bits
  0 and 1 on port PB are usually used for I2C communication, but the
  kernel I2C driver sets the appropriate directions itself so you
  don't need to take that into consideration when setting this option.
  If you don't know what to use, it is always safe to put all as
  inputs.

Etrax General port B data
CONFIG_ETRAX_DEF_R_PORT_PB_DATA
  Configures the initial data for the general port A bits.  Most
  products should use FF here.

Etrax General port device
CONFIG_ETRAX_GPIO
  Enables the Etrax general port device (major 120, minors 0 and 1).
  You can use this driver to access the general port bits. It supports
  these ioctl's:
        #include <linux/etraxgpio.h>
       fd = open("/dev/gpioa", O_RDWR); // or /dev/gpiob
       ioctl(fd, _IO(ETRAXGPIO_IOCTYPE, IO_SETBITS), bits_to_set);
       ioctl(fd, _IO(ETRAXGPIO_IOCTYPE, IO_CLRBITS), bits_to_clear);
       val = ioctl(fd, _IO(ETRAXGPIO_IOCTYPE, IO_READBITS), NULL);
  Remember that you need to setup the port directions appropriately in
  the General configuration.

Etrax parallel data support
CONFIG_ETRAX_PARDATA
  Adds support for writing data to the parallel port par0 of the ETRAX
  100.  If you create a character special file with major number 126,
  you can write to the data bits of par0.
  Note: you need to disable Etrax100 parallel port support.

Etrax parallel LCD (HD44780) Driver
CONFIG_ETRAX_LCD_HD44780
  Adds support for a HD44780 controlled LCD connected to the parallel
  port par0 of the Etrax.

Etrax Serial port ser0 support

  Enables the ETRAX 100 serial driver for ser0 (ttyS0)
  You probably want this enabled.

/proc/serial entry
CONFIG_ETRAX_SERIAL_PROC_ENTRY
  Enables /proc/serial entry where errors and statistics can be
  viewed.  CONFIG_PROC_FS must also be set for this to work.

Etrax Serial port fast flush of DMA using fast timer API
CONFIG_ETRAX_SERIAL_FAST_TIMER
  Select this to have the serial DMAs flushed at a higher rate than
  normally, possible by using the fast timer API, the timeout is
  approx. 4 character times.
  If unsure, say N.

CONFIG_ETRAX_SERIAL_FLUSH_DMA_FAST
  Select this to have the serial DMAs flushed at a higher rate than
  normally possible through a fast timer interrupt (currently at
  15360 Hz).
  If unsure, say N.

Etrax Serial port receive flush timeout

  Number of timer ticks between flush of receive fifo (1 tick = 10ms).
  Try 0-3 for low latency applications.  Approx 5 for high load
  applications (e.g. PPP).  Maybe this should be more adaptive some
  day...

  (just like the SCL and SDA lines).

Etrax DS1302 RST bit number
CONFIG_ETRAX_DS1302_RSTBIT
  This is the bit number for the RST signal line of the DS1302 RTC on
  the selected port. If you have selected the generic port then it
  should be bit 27, otherwise your best bet is bit 5.

Etrax DS1302 SCL bit number
CONFIG_ETRAX_DS1302_SCLBIT
  This is the bit number for the SCL signal line of the DS1302 RTC on
  Port PB. This is probably best left at 3.

Etrax DS1302 SDA bit number
CONFIG_ETRAX_DS1302_SDABIT
  This is the bit number for the SDA signal line of the DS1302 RTC on
  Port PB. This is probably best left at 2.

  This option enables the ETRAX 100LX built-in 10/100Mbit Ethernet
  controller.

ETRAX 100LX Synchronous serial ports
CONFIG_ETRAX_SYNCHRONOUS_SERIAL
  This option enables support for the ETRAX 100LX built-in
  synchronous serial ports. These ports are used for continuous
  streamed data like audio. The default setting is compatible
  with the STA 013 MP3 decoder, but can easily be tuned to fit
  any other audio encoder/decoder and SPI.

  reset.

ARTPEC-1 support
CONFIG_JULIETTE
  The ARTPEC-1 is a video-compression chip used in the AXIS 2100
  network camera, which is built around an ETRAX-100 board.  With this
  option selected, the ETRAX kernel configures a DMA channel at boot
  time to talk to the chip.

Axis flash-map support
CONFIG_ETRAX_AXISFLASHMAP
  This option enables MTD mapping of flash devices.  Needed to use
  flash memories.  If unsure, say Y.

Byte-offset of partition table sector
CONFIG_ETRAX_PTABLE_SECTOR
  Byte-offset of the partition table in the first flash chip.
  The default value is 64kB and should not be changed unless
  you know exactly what you are doing. The only valid reason
  for changing this is when the flash block size is bigger
  than 64kB (e.g. when using two parallel 16 bit flashes).

Enable Etrax100 watchdog
CONFIG_ETRAX_WATCHDOG
  Enable the built-in watchdog timer support on Etrax100 embedded
  network computers.

# Choice: crisdebug

  is port 0.

Serial-1
CONFIG_ETRAX_RESCUE_SER1
  Use serial port 1 as the rescue port.

Serial-2
CONFIG_ETRAX_RESCUE_SER2
  Use serial port 2 as the rescue port.

Serial-3
CONFIG_ETRAX_RESCUE_SER3
  Use serial port 3 as the rescue port.

RIO Hardware Watchdog support
CONFIG_WATCHDOG_RIO
  Say Y here to support the hardware watchdog capability on Sun RIO
  machines.  The watchdog timeout period is normally one minute but
  can be changed with a boot-time parameter.

CP1XXX Hardware Watchdog support
CONFIG_WATCHDOG_CP1XXX
  This is the driver for the hardware watchdog timers present on
  Sun Microsystems CompactPCI models CP1400 and CP1500.

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called cpwatchdog.o. If you want to compile it
  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If you do not have a CompactPCI model CP1400 or CP1500, or
  another UltraSPARC-IIi-cEngine boardset with hardware watchdog,
  you should say N to this option.

# Choice: ia64type
Itanium
CONFIG_ITANIUM
  Select your IA64 processor type.  The default is Intel Itanium.

McKinley
CONFIG_MCKINLEY
  Select this to configure for a McKinley processor.

# Choice: ia64system
IA-64 system type
CONFIG_IA64_GENERIC
  This selects the system type of your hardware.  A "generic" kernel
  will run on any supported IA-64 system.  However, if you configure
  a kernel for your specific system, it will be faster and smaller.

  To find out what type of IA-64 system you have, you may want to
  check the IA-64 Linux web site at <http://www.linux-ia64.org/>.
  As of the time of this writing, most hardware is DIG compliant,
  so the "DIG-compliant" option is usually the right choice.

  HP-simulator   For the HP simulator (<http://software.hp.com/ia64linux/>).
  HP-zx1	 For HP zx1 Platforms.
  SN1            For SGI SN1 Platforms.
  SN2            For SGI SN2 Platforms.
  DIG-compliant  For DIG ("Developer's Interface Guide") compliant systems.

  If you don't know what to do, choose "generic".

CONFIG_IA64_HP_ZX1
  Build a kernel that runs on HP zx1-based systems.  This adds support
  for the zx1 IOMMU and makes root bus bridges appear in PCI config space
  (required for zx1 agpgart support).

CONFIG_IA64_SGI_SN_SIM
  Build a kernel that runs on both the SGI simulator AND on hardware.
  There is a very slight performance penalty on hardware for including this
  option.

CONFIG_IA64_SGI_SN_DEBUG
  This enables addition debug code that helps isolate
  platform/kernel bugs. There is a small but measurable performance
  degradation when this option is enabled.

# Choice: pagesize
Kernel page size
CONFIG_IA64_PAGE_SIZE_4KB
  This lets you select the page size of the kernel.  For best IA-64
  performance, a page size of 8KB or 16KB is recommended.  For best
  IA-32 compatibility, a page size of 4KB should be selected (the vast
  majority of IA-32 binaries work perfectly fine with a larger page
  size).  For Itanium systems, do NOT chose a page size larger than
  16KB.

  4KB                For best IA-32 compatibility
  8KB                For best IA-64 performance
  16KB               For best IA-64 performance
  64KB               Not for Itanium.

  If you don't know what to do, choose 8KB.

Enable Itanium B-step specific code
CONFIG_ITANIUM_BSTEP_SPECIFIC
  Select this option to build a kernel for an Itanium prototype system
  with a B-step CPU.  Only B3 step CPUs are supported.  You have a B3-step
  CPU if the "revision" field in /proc/cpuinfo is equal to 4.  If the
  "revision" field shows a number bigger than 4, you do not have to turn
  on this option.

Enable IA-64 Machine Check Abort
CONFIG_IA64_MCA
  Say Y here to enable machine check support for IA-64.  If you're
  unsure, answer Y.

Disable IA-64 Virtual Hash Page Table
CONFIG_DISABLE_VHPT
  The Virtual Hash Page Table (VHPT) enhances virtual address
  translation performance.  Normally you want the VHPT active but you
  can select this option to disable the VHPT for debugging.  If you're
  unsure, answer N.

Turn on compare-and-exchange bug checking (slow!)
CONFIG_IA64_DEBUG_CMPXCHG
  Selecting this option turns on bug checking for the IA64
  compare-and-exchange instructions.  This is slow!  Itaniums
  from step B3 or later don't have this problem. If you're unsure,
  select N.

IA64 IRQ bug checking
CONFIG_IA64_DEBUG_IRQ
  Selecting this option turns on bug checking for the IA64 irq_save
  and restore instructions.  It's useful for tracking down spinlock
  problems, but slow!  If you're unsure, select N.

Early printk support (requires VGA!)
CONFIG_IA64_EARLY_PRINTK
  Selecting this option uses the VGA screen for printk() output before
  the consoles are initialised.  It is useful for debugging problems
  early in the boot process, but only if you have a VGA screen
  attached.  If you're unsure, select N.

Print possible IA64 hazards to console
CONFIG_IA64_PRINT_HAZARDS
  Selecting this option prints more information for Illegal Dependency
  Faults, that is, for Read after Write, Write after Write or Write
  after Read violations.  If you're unsure, select Y.

Performance monitor support
CONFIG_PERFMON
  Selects whether support for the IA-64 performance monitor hardware
  is included in the kernel.  This makes some kernel data-structures a
  little bigger and slows down execution a bit, but it is still
  usually a good idea to turn this on.  If you're unsure, say N.

/proc/pal support
CONFIG_IA64_PALINFO
  If you say Y here, you are able to get PAL (Processor Abstraction
  Layer) information in /proc/pal.  This contains useful information
  about the processors in your systems, such as cache and TLB sizes
  and the PAL firmware version in use.

  To use this option, you have to check that the "/proc file system
  support" (CONFIG_PROC_FS) is enabled, too.

/proc/efi/vars support
CONFIG_EFI_VARS
  If you say Y here, you are able to get EFI (Extensible Firmware
  Interface) variable information in /proc/efi/vars.  You may read,
  write, create, and destroy EFI variables through this interface.

  To use this option, you have to check that the "/proc file system
  support" (CONFIG_PROC_FS) is enabled, too.

Kernel support for IA-32 emulation
CONFIG_IA32_SUPPORT
  IA64 processors can run IA32 (that is, x86) binaries by emulating
  the IA32 instruction set.  Say Y here to build in kernel support for
  this.  If in doubt, say Y.

Physical memory granularity (16 MB)
CONFIG_IA64_GRANULE_16MB
  IA64 identity-mapped regions use a large page size.  We'll call such
  large pages "granules".  If you can think of a better name that's
  unambiguous, let us know...  Unless your identity-mapped regions are
  very large, select a granule size of 16MB.

Physical memory granularity (64 MB)
CONFIG_IA64_GRANULE_64MB
  IA64 identity-mapped regions use a large page size.  We'll call such
  large pages "granules".  If you can think of a better name that's
  unambiguous, let us know...  Unless your identity-mapped regions are
  very large, select a granule size of 16MB.  (This is the "large" choice.)

Enable SGI SN extra debugging code
CONFIG_IA64_SGI_SN_DEBUG
  Turns on extra debugging code in the SGI SN (Scalable NUMA) platform
  for IA64.  Unless you are debugging problems on an SGI SN IA64 box,
  say N.

Enable SGI Medusa Simulator Support
CONFIG_IA64_SGI_SN_SIM
  If you are compiling a kernel that will run under SGI's IA64
  simulator (Medusa) then say Y, otherwise say N.

PCIBA Support
CONFIG_PCIBA
  IRIX PCIBA-inspired user mode PCI interface for the SGI SN (Scalable
  NUMA) platform for IA64.  Unless you are compiling a kernel for an              SGI SN IA64 box, say N.

Enable protocol mode for the L1 console
SERIAL_SGI_L1_PROTOCOL
  Uses protocol mode instead of raw mode for the level 1 console on the
  SGI SN (Scalable NUMA) platform for IA64.  If you are compiling for
  an SGI SN box then Y is the recommended value, otherwise say N.

Directly Connected Compact Flash support
CONFIG_CF_ENABLER
  Compact Flash is a small, removable mass storage device introduced
  in 1994 originally as a PCMCIA device.  If you say `Y' here, you
  compile in support for Compact Flash devices directly connected to
  a SuperH processor.  A Compact Flash FAQ is available at
  <http://www.compactflash.org/faqs/faq.htm>.

  If your board has "Directly Connected" CompactFlash at area 5 or 6,
  you may want to enable this option.  Then, you can use CF as
  primary IDE drive (only tested for SanDisk).

  If in doubt, select 'N'.

Kernel debugging
CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL
  Say Y here if you are developing drivers or trying to debug and
  identify kernel problems.

Debug memory allocations
CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB
  Say Y here to have the kernel do limited verification on memory
  allocation as well as poisoning memory on free to catch use of freed
  memory.

Memory mapped I/O debugging
CONFIG_DEBUG_IOVIRT
  Say Y here to get warned whenever an attempt is made to do I/O on
  obviously invalid addresses such as those generated when ioremap()
  calls are forgotten.  Memory mapped I/O will go through an extra
  check to catch access to unmapped ISA addresses, an access method
  that can still be used by old drivers that are being ported from
  2.0/2.2.

Spinlock debugging
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK
  Say Y here and build SMP to catch missing spinlock initialization
  and certain other kinds of spinlock errors commonly made.  This is
  best used in conjunction with the NMI watchdog so that spinlock
  deadlocks are also debuggable.

Read-write spinlock debugging
CONFIG_DEBUG_RWLOCK
  If you say Y here then read-write lock processing will count how many
  times it has tried to get the lock and issue an error message after
  too many attempts.  If you suspect a rwlock problem or a kernel
  hacker asks for this option then say Y.  Otherwise say N.

Semaphore debugging
CONFIG_DEBUG_SEMAPHORE
  If you say Y here then semaphore processing will issue lots of
  verbose debugging messages.  If you suspect a semaphore problem or a
  kernel hacker asks for this option then say Y.  Otherwise say N.

Verbose BUG() reporting (adds 70K)
CONFIG_DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE
  Say Y here to make BUG() panics output the file name and line number
  of the BUG call as well as the EIP and oops trace.  This aids
  debugging but costs about 70-100K of memory.

Include kgdb kernel debugger
CONFIG_KGDB
  Include in-kernel hooks for kgdb, the Linux kernel source level
  debugger.  This project has a web page at
  <http://kgdb.sourceforge.net/>.

Include xmon kernel debugger
CONFIG_XMON
  Include in-kernel hooks for the xmon kernel monitor/debugger
  supported by the PPC port.

Include BDI2000 debugger support
CONFIG_BDI_SWITCH
  Include in-kernel support for the Abatron BDI2000 debugger.  To
  learn more about the Abatron BDI2000, visit the web page at
  <http://www.abatron.ch/>.

Add additional CFLAGS to the kernel build
CONFIG_MORE_COMPILE_OPTIONS
  If you want to add additional CFLAGS to the kernel build, such as
  -g for KGDB, XMON or the BDI2000, enable this option and then
  enter what you would like to add in the next question.

Include kgdb kernel debugger
CONFIG_KWDB
  Include in-kernel hooks for kdb, the source level debugger for the
  PA-RISC port.

IODC console
CONFIG_IODC_CONSOLE
  IODC is HP's pre-PCI standard for device identification (a la PCI
  vendor, device IDs), detection, configuration, initialization and so
  on.  It also can provide firmware function to do the actual IO,
  which are slow, not really defined for runtime usage and generally
  not desirable.

  See <http://www.linuxhq.com/kernel/v2.4/doc/parisc/IODC.txt.html>
  for the gory details.

  Say Y here to enable use of the IODC firmware functions for console
  I/O.  This is only useful on older PA-RISC workstations.  If in
  doubt, say Y.

U2/Uturn I/O MMU
CONFIG_IOMMU_CCIO
  Say Y here to enable DMA management routines for the first
  generation of PA-RISC cache-coherent machines.  Programs the
  U2/Uturn chip in "Virtual Mode" and use the I/O MMU.

LBA/Elroy PCI support
CONFIG_PCI_LBA
  Say Y here to give the PA-RISC kernel access to PCI configuration
  and IO-port space on PA-RISC workstations equipped with a Lower Bus
  Adapter (LBA).  This includes A, B, C, J, L, and N-class machines
  with 4-digit model numbers, also the A300.

LASI I/O support
CONFIG_GSC_LASI
  Say Y here to directly support the LASI controller chip found on
  PA-RISC workstations.  Linux-oriented documentation for this chip
  can be found at <http://www.parisc-linux.org/documentation/>.

LASI/ASP builtin parallel-port
CONFIG_PARPORT_GSC
  Say Y here to build in low-level parallel-support for PC-style
  hardware integrated in the LASI-Controller (on the GSC Bus) for
  HP-PARISC workstations.

  Enable vendor-specific code for Western Digital IDE disks.  Unless
  you are the IDE maintainer, you probably do not want to mess with
  this.

TiVo Commerial Application Specific
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_TIVO
  Enable vendor-specific code for TiVo IDE disks.  Unless you are the
  IDE maintainer, you probably do not want to mess with this.

BareCPU
CONFIG_SH_UNKNOWN
  "Bare CPU" aka "unknown" means an SH-based system which is not one
  of the specific ones mentioned above, which means you need to enter
  all sorts of stuff like CONFIG_MEMORY_START because the config
  system doesn't already know what it is.  You get a machine vector

  The physical memory (RAM) start address will be automatically
  set to 08000000, unless you selected one of the following
  processor types: SolutionEngine, Overdrive, HP620, HP680, HP690,
  in which case the start address will be set to 0c000000.

  Tweak this only when porting to a new machine which is not already
  known by the config system.  Changing it from the known correct
  value on any of the known systems will only lead to disaster.

Hitachi HD64461 companion chip support
CONFIG_HD64461
  The Hitachi HD64461 provides an interface for
  the SH7709 CPU, supporting a LCD controller,
  CRT color controller, IrDA up to 4 Mbps, and a
  PCMCIA controller supporting 2 slots.

  More information is available at
  <http://semiconductor.hitachi.com/windowsce/superh/sld013.htm>.

  Say Y if you want support for the HD64461.
  Otherwise, say N.

HD64461 PCMCIA enabler
CONFIG_HD64461_ENABLER
  Say Y here if you want to enable PCMCIA support
  via the HD64461 companion chip.
  Otherwise, say N.

HD64461 virtualized IRQ number
CONFIG_HD64461_IRQ
  The default setting of the HD64461 IRQ is 36.

  Do not change this unless you know what you are doing.

Hitachi HD64465 companion chip support
CONFIG_HD64465
  The Hitachi HD64465 provides an interface for
  the SH7750 CPU, supporting a LCD controller,
  CRT color controller, IrDA, USB, PCMCIA,
  keyboard controller, and a printer interface.

  More information is available at
  <http://global.hitachi.com/New/cnews/E/1998/981019B.html>.

  Say Y if you want support for the HD64465.
  Otherwise, say N.

HD64465 virtualized IRQ number
CONFIG_HD64465_IRQ
  The default setting of the HD64465 IRQ is 5.

  Do not change this unless you know what you are doing.

HD64465 start address
CONFIG_HD64465_IOBASE
  The default setting of the HD64465 IO base address is 0xb0000000.

  Do not change this unless you know what you are doing.
  
Early printk support
CONFIG_SH_EARLY_PRINTK
  Say Y here to redirect kernel printk messages to the serial port
  used by the SH-IPL bootloader, starting very early in the boot
  process and ending when the kernel's serial console is initialised.
  This option is only useful porting the kernel to a new machine,
  when the kernel may crash or hang before the serial console is
  initialised. If unsure, say N.

SuperH SCI (serial) support
CONFIG_SH_SCI
  Selecting this option will allow the Linux kernel to transfer data
  over SCI (Serial Communication Interface) and/or SCIF (Serial
  Communication Interface with FIFO) which are built into the Hitachi
  SuperH processor.  The option provides 1 to 3 (depending
  on the CPU model) standard Linux tty devices, /dev/ttySC[012]; one
  of these is normally used as the system console.

  If in doubt, press "y".

Use LinuxSH standard BIOS
CONFIG_SH_STANDARD_BIOS
  Say Y here if your target has the gdb-sh-stub
  package from www.m17n.org (or any conforming standard LinuxSH BIOS)
  in FLASH or EPROM.  The kernel will use standard BIOS calls during
  boot for various housekeeping tasks (including calls to read and
  write characters to a system console, get a MAC address from an
  on-board Ethernet interface, and shut down the hardware).  Note this
  does not work with machines with an existing operating system in
  mask ROM and no flash (WindowsCE machines fall in this category).
  If unsure, say N.

GDB Stub kernel debug
CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL_WITH_GDB_STUB
  If you say Y here, it will be possible to remotely debug the SuperH
  kernel using gdb, if you have the gdb-sh-stub package from
  www.m17n.org (or any conforming standard LinuxSH BIOS) in FLASH or
  EPROM.  This enlarges your kernel image disk size by several
  megabytes but allows you to load, run and debug the kernel image
  remotely using gdb.  This is only useful for kernel hackers.  If
  unsure, say N.

Console output to GDB
CONFIG_GDB_CONSOLE
  If you are using GDB for remote debugging over a serial port and
  would like kernel messages to be formatted into GDB $O packets so
  that GDB prints them as program output, say 'Y'.

802.1Q VLAN Support
CONFIG_VLAN_8021Q
  Select this and you will be able to create 802.1Q VLAN interfaces on your
  ethernet interfaces.  802.1Q VLAN supports almost everything a regular
  ethernet interface does, including firewalling, bridging, and of course
  IP traffic.  You will need the 'vconfig' tool from the VLAN project in
  order to effectively use VLANs.  See the VLAN web page for more
  information:  <http://www.candelatech.com/~greear/vlan.html>  If unsure,
  you can safely say 'N'.

ARC console support
CONFIG_ARC_CONSOLE
  Support for the PROM-based console on MIPS machines built according
  to the Advanced Risc Computing specification, which is now (2001)
  dead.  These included boxes from Deskstation, Acer, Olivetti and
  NEC.  There is a history at <http://www.openbsd.org/arc.html>.

AUTCPU12
CONFIG_ARCH_AUTCPU12
  Say Y if you intend to run the kernel on the autronix autcpu12
  board. This board is based on a Cirrus Logic CS89712.

IT8172 IDE support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IT8172
  Say Y here to support the on-board IDE controller on the Integrated
  Technology Express, Inc. ITE8172 SBC.  Vendor page at
  <http://www.ite.com.tw/ia/brief_it8172bsp.htm>; picture of the
  board at <http://www.mvista.com/allies/semiconductor/ite.html>.

Support ARM926T processor
CONFIG_CPU_ARM926T
  This is a variant of the ARM920.  It has slightly different
  instruction sequences for cache and TLB operations.  Curiously,
  there is no documentation on it at the ARM corporate website.

  Say Y if you want support for the ARM926T processor.
  Otherwise, say N.

Support CPU clock change (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_CPU_FREQ
  CPU clock scaling allows you to change the clock speed of the
  running CPU on the fly. This is a nice method to save battery power,
  because the lower the clock speed, the less power the CPU
  consumes. Note that this driver doesn't automatically change the CPU
  clock speed, you need some userland tools (which still have to be
  written) to implement the policy. If you don't understand what this
  is all about, it's safe to say 'N'.

SiS
CONFIG_DRM_SIS
  Choose this option if you have a SIS graphics card. AGP support is
  required for this driver to work.

Etrax Ethernet slave support (over lp0/1)
CONFIG_ETRAX_ETHERNET_LPSLAVE
  This option enables a slave ETRAX 100 or ETRAX 100LX, connected to a
  master ETRAX 100 or ETRAX 100LX through par0 and par1, to act as an
  Ethernet controller.

Slave has its own LEDs
CONFIG_ETRAX_ETHERNET_LPSLAVE_HAS_LEDS
  Enable if the slave has it's own LEDs.

ATA/IDE support
CONFIG_ETRAX_IDE
  Enable this to get support for ATA/IDE.  You can't use parallel
  ports or SCSI ports at the same time.

LED on when link
CONFIG_ETRAX_NETWORK_LED_ON_WHEN_LINK

  Selecting LED_on_when_link will light the LED when there is a
  connection and will flash off when there is activity.

  Selecting LED_on_when_activity will light the LED only when
  there is activity.

  This setting will also affect the behaviour of other activity LEDs
  e.g. Bluetooth.

Power button bit on port G
CONFIG_ETRAX_POWERBUTTON_BIT
  Configure where power button is connected.

Root device name
CONFIG_ETRAX_ROOT_DEVICE
  Specifies the device that should be mounted as root file system
  when booting from flash. The axisflashmap driver adds an additional
  mtd partition for the appended root file system image, so this option
  should normally be the mtdblock device for the partition after the
  last partition in the partition table.

Serial port 0 enabled
CONFIG_ETRAX_SERIAL_PORT0
  Enables the ETRAX 100 serial driver for ser0 (ttyS0)
  Normally you want this on, unless you use external DMA 1 that uses
  the same DMA channels.

Shutdown bit on port CSP0
CONFIG_ETRAX_SHUTDOWN_BIT
  Configure what pin on CSPO-port that is used for controlling power
  supply.

Software Shutdown Support
CONFIG_ETRAX_SOFT_SHUTDOWN
  Enable this if Etrax is used with a power-supply that can be turned
  off and on with PS_ON signal. Gives the possibility to detect
  powerbutton and then do a power off after unmounting disks.

Disable watchdog during Oops printouts
CONFIG_ETRAX_WATCHDOG_NICE_DOGGY
  By enabling this you make sure that the watchdog does not bite while
  printing oopses. Recommended for development systems but not for
  production releases.

Compaq iPAQ Handheld sleeve support
CONFIG_H3600_SLEEVE
  Choose this option to enable support for extension packs (sleeves)
  for the Compaq iPAQ H3XXX series of handheld computers.  This option
  is required for the CF, PCMCIA, Bluetooth and GSM/GPRS extension
  packs.

AVM Fritz!Card PCI/PCIv2/PnP support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_HISAX_FRITZ_PCIPNP
  This enables the driver for the AVM Fritz!Card PCI, Fritz!Card PCI v2
  and Fritz!Card PnP.
  (the latter also needs you to select "ISA Plug and Play support"
  from the menu "Plug and Play configuration")

IBM PCI Hotplug driver
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_IBM
  Say Y here if you have a motherboard with a IBM PCI Hotplug
  controller.

  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called cpqphp.o. If you want to compile it
  as a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt.

  When in doubt, say N.

Enable autotest (llsc). Option to run cache test instead of booting
CONFIG_IA64_SGI_AUTOTEST
  Build a kernel used for hardware validation. If you include the
  keyword "autotest" on the boot command line, the kernel does NOT boot.
  Instead, it starts all cpus and runs cache coherency tests instead.

  If unsure, say N.

IEC61883-6 (Audio transmission) support
CONFIG_IEEE1394_AMDTP
  This option enables the Audio & Music Data Transmission Protocol
  (IEC61883-6) driver, which implements audio transmission over
  IEEE1394.

  The userspace interface is documented in amdtp.h.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt.  The module
  will be called amdtp.o.

IEC61883-1 Plug support
CONFIG_IEEE1394_CMP
  This option enables the Connection Management Procedures
  (IEC61883-1) driver, which implements input and output plugs.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt.  The module
  will be called amdtp.o.

OHCI-DV I/O support
CONFIG_IEEE1394_DV1394
  This driver allows you to transmit and receive DV (digital video)
  streams on an OHCI-1394 card using a simple frame-oriented
  interface.

  The user-space API for dv1394 is documented in dv1394.h.

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt.  The module
  will be called dv1394.o.

Ethernet over 1394
CONFIG_IEEE1394_ETH1394
  Extremely Experimental! This driver is a Linux specific way to use your
  IEEE1394 Host as an Ethernet type device. This is _NOT_ IP1394.

Support for older IT8172 (Rev C)
CONFIG_IT8172_REVC
  Say Y here to support the older, Revision C version of the Integrated
  Technology Express, Inc. ITE8172 SBC.  Vendor page at
  <http://www.ite.com.tw/ia/brief_it8172bsp.htm>; picture of the
  board at <http://www.mvista.com/allies/semiconductor/ite.html>.

Enable Smart Card Reader 1 Support
CONFIG_IT8172_SCR1
  Say Y here to support smart-card reader 1 (SCR1) on the Integrated
  Technology Express, Inc. ITE8172 SBC.  Vendor page at
  <http://www.ite.com.tw/ia/brief_it8172bsp.htm>; picture of the
  board at <http://www.mvista.com/allies/semiconductor/ite.html>.

IT8172 IDE Tuning support
CONFIG_IT8172_TUNING
  Say Y here to support tuning the ITE8172's IDE interface.  This makes
  it possible to set DMA channel or PIO opration and the transfer rate.

Enable protocol mode for the L1 console
CONFIG_SERIAL_SGI_L1_PROTOCOL
  Uses protocol mode instead of raw mode for the level 1 console on the
  SGI SN (Scalable NUMA) platform for IA64.  If you are compiling for
  an SGI SN box then Y is the recommended value, otherwise say N.

New bus configuration (EXPERIMENTAL)  
CONFIG_TULIP_MWI
  This configures your Tulip card specifically for the card and
  system cache line size type you are using.

  This is experimental code, not yet tested on many boards.

  If unsure, say N.
