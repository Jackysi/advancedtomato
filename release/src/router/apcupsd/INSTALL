Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes a while.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Become root if not already with `su'.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation. If you have a previously installed version of this
         package, it is advisable to issue a `make uninstall' before doing
         the installation. This will clean the halt.local script for suse
         and any other old halt script for other distributions. We can not
         guarantee a good behaviour of the software if you install a new
         version over an older one without prior uninstall the older one.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  

  6. You can remove the program from where it was installed with
     `make uninstall.'

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:
     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
architecture.

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
/usr/local/sbin and /usr/local/man. You can specify an installation
prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the option
`--prefix=PATH'. Usually good installation paths are `--prefix=/usr'
and `--sbindir=/sbin'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the host type.

   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
system on which you are compiling the package.

Sharing Defaults
================

   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Operation Controls
==================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.

Configure options for APC UPS Daemon
====================================

The apcupsd have a number of `configure' time options that can be enabled for
additional features. These options are:

`--enable-powerflute'
     Enable the compilation of `powerflute' an ncurses based program to
     monitor the UPS.

`--enable-nls'
     Enable the support for Native Language Support.

`--with-included-gettext'
     Enable the compilation of the GNU gettext library that is included in
     this package. Gettext is part of NLS support so there's no point enabling
     this option and with NLS support disabled.

`--with-catgets'
     Enable the use of the `catgets' function if available.

`--with-libwrap=yes or --with-libwrap=[DIR]
     Enable the use of libwrap. When set to yes enables libwrap
     system library. When set to [DIR] enables libwrap in DIR.

For RedHat Linux 9 users, some useful configure options are:
===========================================================

 ./configure --enable-threads --enable-cgi --with-cgi-bin=/var/www/cgi-bin

Adjust --with-cgi-bin argument to reflect the location of your web server
pages.

Prior to running configure, make sure the following to packages are installed
on your system.

	gd-1.8.4-11
	gd-devel-1.8.4-11

These packages are on the RedHat 9 distribution disks. If these packages
are installed, the cgi code will use these libraries for generation of png
images. If these are not installed, the version included with apcupsd will
be used instead.

Configuring Apache HTTP Server for use with cgi support
=======================================================
If you configure apcupsd with the --enable-cgi support you may need to make
configuration changes to the httpd.conf file. The changes you will need to
make depend on what directory you choose install the cgi files in.

There are five files which are installed in the cgi-bin directory.
Four of these are .cgi files which are executable images and the fifth file
is apcupsd.css which is a style sheet used to give a common style to all output.

There are two ways of enabling cgi support for Apache. The first method is
to add the following line to httpd.conf:

	ScriptAlias /cgi-bin /var/www/cgi-bin

The second method is to add the following lines to httpd.conf:

	Alias /cgi-bin /var/www/cgi-bin
	<Directory /var/www/cgi-bin>
		Options +ExecCGI
	</Directory>
	AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

The first example tells Apache that all files in the cgi-bin directory are
executable cgi programs. The second example tells Apache that programs in
the cgi-bin directory may be executable cgi programs if the file extension
is .cgi. You can also add extra extensions to the AddHandler directive if
you have other files in the directory. For example, if you have perl files
in your cgi-bin directory:

	AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl

Using the first example, you will have a problem with trying to serve
the file apcupsd.css. Since this file is installed in the cgi-bin directory,
Apache will assume it is an executable program and will produce an error
when trying to serve it. You must use the second method of enabling cgi
support.

If you are using the default Apache configuration file, you  will need
to remove (or comment out) the first example and replace it with the second.

If you install the apcupsd cgi files in another directory, you will need to
add the second example to your httpd.conf file and adjust the pathname
accordingly.

Customization of apcupsd events 
================================

Note, this is somewhat out of date, please check the installed
apccontrol script for exact details of these events.

When apcupsd detects anomalies from your UPS device, it will make some
decisions that usually result in one or more calls to the script located
in `${sysconf}/apcupsd/apccontrol'.  The apcaction file is a shell script
that acts on the first argument that `apcupsd' passes to it.  These
actions are set up by default to sane behaviour for all possible
situations apcupsd is likely to detect from the UPS. Nevertheless you
can change the apccontrol behaviour for every single action.  To do so
create a file with the same name as the action, which is passed as the
first argument (argv[1], or $1 for shell scripts).  Put your script in
`${sysconf}/apcupsd/' directory.  At present the arguments that apcaction
can recognize are:

 Keyword       Default Action
============  ==============================================================
`powerout'     `wall' a message telling `There are power problems'.
`onbattery'    `wall' a message telling `System is on battery'.
`offbattery'   None  
`mainsback'    Attempt to cancel a running `shutdown' sequence.
`failing'      `wall' a message telling `Battery power is failing'.
`timeout'      `wall' a message telling `Timeout on Battery reached'.
`loadlimit'    `wall' a message telling `Battery load limit reached'.
`runlimit'     `wall' a message telling `Battery runtime limit reached'.
`doreboot'     Begins the `shutdown -r' sequence.
`doshutdown'   Begins the `shutdown -h' sequence.
`annoyme'      `wall' a message telling `Power problems, logoff now'.
`emergency'    Begins an emercengy `shutdown' sequence.
`changeme'     `wall' a message telling `Battery failed, change them now'.
`remotedown'   Begins the `shutdown' sequence, called from remote.

If for example you want to write your own routine for the `powerout' action,
you can write your own shell script called `powerout' and put it in the lib
directory. Doing so will _completely disable_ the `apcaction' default
behaviour and enable your script. If you want to write your customized scripts
you are encouraged to edit the `${libdir}/apcupsd/apccontrol' script and at
least mimic its behaviour into your own script.
Writing faulty scripts may cause your system to crash due to power failures.
