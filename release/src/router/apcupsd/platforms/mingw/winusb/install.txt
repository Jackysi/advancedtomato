INSTALLING APCUPSD WINDOWS USB DRIVER

USB connected UPSes on Windows require a special driver. In most cases, 
this driver is automatically installed when you install Apcupsd. However,
in some cases, you will need to install the driver by hand.


SUPPORTED OPERATING SYSTEMS

The USB driver supports the following operating systems:

   - Windows XP Service Pack 2
   - Windows 2003 Service Service Pack 2
   - Windows Vista (including 64 bit)
   - Windows 7 (including 64 bit)
   - Windows 2008 Server (including 64 bit)

Notably, Windows 2000, Windows 98, and Windows ME are NOT supported.


TROUBLESHOOTING

- If the driver fails to start and Windows gives an "Error Code 10" this is
  most likely because you updated the driver on "Batteries / HID UPS Battery"
  instead of "Human Interface Devices / American Power Conversion USB UPS". To
  fix this, uninstall the driver from the device that is giving the error code,
  then do an update driver on the correct device.


INSTALLATION

Follow these instructions to install the Apcupsd USB driver. If you have the 
old LibUSB driver installed already, go to the UPGRADE section below instead.

    a. Plug in your USB UPS and wait for Windows to recognize it.

    b. Open the Windows Device Manager and locate the "Human Interface
       Devices" section

    c. Locate "American Power Conversion USB UPS" under the HID section.

    d. Right-click "American Power Conversion USB UPS" and select
       "Update driver..."

    e. (Abbreviated) Do not allow Windows to search for a driver,
       specify one yourself. Depending on your version of Windows, the exact
       sequence of dialogs and options is different, but essentially you need
       to get to the list of devices with the "Have Disk..." button. When you 
       get there, choose "Have Disk..."

    f. Browse to "C:\apcupsd\driver" and hit Open

    g. Select "American Power Conversion USB UPS (Apcupsd)" and hit
       Next.

    h. The driver should be installed.

    i. If you examine the Device Manager tree again, you should see 
       "American Power Conversion USB UPS (Apcupsd)" listed in the 
       "Batteries" section.

    Future plugging/unplugging of the UPS will be handled automatically.
    The driver only needs to be installed once.

    To UNINSTALL the driver and return to the Windows standard driver, go into
    Device Manager and do an "Update Driver..." on "American Power Conversion 
    USB UPS (Apcupsd)". Select the "American Power Conversion USB UPS 
    (Microsoft)" driver from the list. After that you should be back where you
    started. The "Batteries -> HID UPS Battery" entry should be back.


UPGRADING FROM LIBUSB DRIVER

instructions.

       "LibUSB-Win32 Devices".

    c. Locate "American Power Conversion USB UPS (Apcupsd)"

    d. Right-click "American Power Conversion USB UPS" and select
       "Update driver..."
