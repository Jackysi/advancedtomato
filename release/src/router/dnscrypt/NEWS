* Version 1.6.0:
 - New feature: public-key based client authentication (-K), for
private and commercial DNS services to securely authenticate the
sender of a query no matter what the source IP address is, without
altering the DNS query.
 - On Windows, paths are now relative to the application folder. Which
means that the -L option is usually not required any more if the CSV file is
in the same folder as the dnscrypt-proxy executable. Full paths to
plugins are not required any more either; plugin names can be given
directly.

* Version 1.5.0:
 - New option: -E, to use an ephemeral key pair for each query.
 - Logging to files is supported on Windows.
 - TCP FASTOPEN is now enabled on Linux.

* Version 1.4.3:
 - libevent update, including a fix for CVE-2014-6272
 - Two new public dnscrypt resolvers were added: opennic-us-wa-ns1 and
dnscrypt.org-fr.
 - d0wn servers in France IP have changed.
 - Compilation fixes.

* Version 1.4.2:
 - New compilation switch: --with-systemd, to enable socket activation
support when using systemd.
 - The list of public DNSCrypt-enabled resolvers was updated.
 - Libevent2 updates.

* Version 1.4.1:
 - Alternative ports to dnscrypt.eu servers have been added
 - Android build scripts are now part of the package
 - UDP queries timing out are not retried any more. This caused some issues
and was already better handled by stub resolvers and caching name servers.

* Version 1.4.0:
 - Security: versions 0.11 to 1.3.3 were vulnerable to a denial of
service when running out of output buffer space. Reported by @iamultra.
 - Windows: --uninstall now actually stops the service
 - Windows: registry keys are automatically created for a given
provider when installing the service.
 - The resolver to use and its configuration can now be specified as a
definition file + the name of the resolver to use. The new
command-line options to use are --resolvers-list=<csv file> (optional
on non-Windows platforms) and --resolver-name=<name>. This deprecates
--provider-key, --provider-name and --resolver-address.
 - Documentation and diagnostics have been improved.

* Version 1.3.3:
 - Try to send questions as big as the response can be. Upgrading is
highly recommended, as the server can refuse to respond to queries using
UDP if the response is larger than the question.

* Version 1.3.2:
 - faster startup on iOS and Android
 - New command-line switch: --test, in order to check if a certificate can be
   used, with an optional time safety margin.
 - The package now includes an AppArmor profile, thanks to InsanityBit.
 - Plugins using ldns can now be compiled on Windows.

* Version 1.3.1:
 - dnscrypt-proxy doesn't ship its own, possibly outdated copy of libsodium
   any more, and always picks the system one instead.
 - Minor compilation improvements for iOS, Android and FreeBSD.

* Version 1.3.0:
 - The bundled NaCl library with only reference implementations has been
   replaced with libsodium, leading to significant performance improvements.
 - A new command-line switch, --loglevel, allows adjusting the log verbosity.

* Version 1.2.1:
 - Add support for certificates split into multiple TXT records.
   Contributed by Yecheng Fu, thanks!

* Version 1.2.0:
 - A pre-filter can now totally bypass the resolver and directly send a
   reply to the client.
 - A new example plugin has been shipped: ldns-aaaa-blocking. It
   directly sends an empty response to AAAA queries in order to
   significantly speed up lookups on hosts without IPv6 connectivity
   (but with clients still asking for AAAA records anyway).
 - Example plugins requiring ldns can be compiled on Windows.
 - Paths with a drive name are now recognized as absolute paths on
   Windows.

* Version 1.1.0:
 - dnscrypt-proxy can now use plugins in order to alter/inspect
   queries and responses before and after they are relayed.
   See README-PLUGINS.markdown for more information.
 - The default max payload size has been trimmed down to 1252 bytes
   for compatibility with some scary network setups.
 - The --local-port and --resolver-port options are gone for good.
   They had been deprecated for a while and were undocumented since
   version 1.0.
 - Multiple certificates are now properly handled.
 - Memory leaks have been fixed, a big bad use-after-free condition
   has been fixed, uninitialized variables have been initialized.
   Upgrading is recommended, especially on Windows.

* Version 1.0.1:
 - dnscrypt-proxy and hostip can now be compiled for Android and
   Solaris.
 - The proxy can now run as a Windows service. The new --install and
   --uninstall command-line switches can automatically register the proxy
   as a service. Startup options are read from the Windows registry.
   See the README-WINDOWS.markdown file for details.

* Version 1.0:
 - Autotools scripts have been improved.
 - 1.0.

* Version 0.12:
 - Datagrams are resent after running out of memory, or if the queue
   was full.
 - Missing compilation flags broke 0.11 on some Linux distributions.
   This has been fixed.

* Version 0.11:
 - A new tool, hostip, can resolve host names before dnscrypt-proxy is
   started. This should help resolving chicken-and-egg problems on
   routers, as reported by LanceThePants.
 - The --local-port and --resolver-port options have been deprecated.
   Please use --local-address=<ip>:<port> and
   --resolver-address=<ip>:<port> instead.
 - Improved stability on Win32.

* Version 0.10.1:
 - The daemon didn't start on some Linux distributions lacking the
   RANDOM_UUID sysctl. This has been fixed.
 - The config.guess files have been patched in order to run out of the
   box on Bitrig.

* Version 0.10:
 - Almost a complete rewrite, with libuv being replaced by libevent.
 - The max number of simultaneous queries is now global, not
   per-protocol.
 - As an insane amount of routers and ISPs are hijacking port 53, the default
   server port is now 443.
 - iOS binaries are now smaller.
 - More dtrace probes.

* Version 0.9.5:
 - Full IPv6 support.

* Version 0.9.4:
 - The --tcp-port option is gone. The resolver port can now be set
   with --resolver-port= and forcing use of TCP can be achieved with
   --tcp-only.
 - portage files for Gentoo have been added.
 - Libuv has been updated.

* Version 0.9.3:
 - Support for native Windows builds.
 - --daemonize has been fixed.

* Version 0.9.2:
 - Support for cross-compilation. In particular, the proxy can now
   compile and work on iOS.

* Version 0.9.1:
 - DNSCrypt should compile out of the box on DD-WRT and other
   uclibc-based systems.

* Version 0.9:
 - libuv has been updated.
 - Enhanced compatibility with non-Intel architectures.

* Version 0.8:
 - Support for Windows (through Cygwin, for now) has been improved.
 - Documentation has been improved.
 - The package now compiles on Dragonfly BSD-current.
 - Signatures are now using ed25519 instead of edwards25519sha512batch.
 - The proxy now compiles on Openwall Linux.
 - Libuv has been updated.
 - A sample .plist file and a Homebrew formula for OSX are now provided.

* Version 0.7:
 - Initial public release.
