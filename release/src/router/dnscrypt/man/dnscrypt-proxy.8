.
.SH "NAME"
\fBdnscrypt\-proxy\fR \- A DNSCrypt forwarder
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBdnscrypt\-proxy\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBdnscrypt\-proxy\fR accepts DNS requests, encrypts and signs them using dnscrypt and forwards them to a remote dnscrypt\-enabled resolver\.
.
.P
Replies from the resolver are expected also to be encrypted and signed\.
.
.P
The proxy verifies the signature of replies, decrypts them, and transparently forwards them to the local stub resolver\.
.
.P
\fBdnscrypt\-proxy\fR listens to \fB127\.0\.0\.1\fR / port \fB53\fR by default\.
.
.SH "WARNING"
\fBdnscrypt\-proxy\fR is not a DNS cache\. Unless your operating system already provides a decent built\-in cache (and by default, most systems don\'t), clients shouldn\'t directly send requests to \fBdnscrypt\-proxy\fR\.
.
.P
Intead, run a DNS cache like \fBUnbound\fR, and configure it to use \fBdnscrypt\-proxy\fR as a forwarder\. Both can safely run on the same machine as long as they use different IP addresses and/or different ports\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-local\-address=<ip>\fR: what local IP the daemon will listen to\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-daemonize\fR: detach from the current terminal and run the server in background\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-edns\-payload\-size=<bytes>\fR: transparently add an OPT pseudo\-RR to outgoing queries in order to enable the EDNS0 extension mechanism\. The payload size is the size of the largest response we accept from the resolver before retrying over TCP\. This feature is enabled by default, with a payload size of 1280 bytes\. Any value below 512 disables it\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR: show usage\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-provider\-key=<key>\fR: specify the provider public key (see below)\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-logfile=<file>\fR: log events to this file instead of the standard output\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-max\-active\-requests=<count>\fR: set the maximum number of simultaneous active requests\. The default value is 250\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-pidfile=<file>\fR: write the PID number to a file\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-resolver\-address=<ip>\fR: a DNSCrypt\-capable resolver IP address\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-tcp\-port=<port>\fR: connect to the resolver on port \fIport\fR over TCP, as a workaround if UDP over port 53 is filtered\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-user=<user name>\fR: chroot(2) to this user\'s home directory and drop privileges\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-provider\-name=<FQDN>\fR: the fully\-qualified name of the dnscrypt certificate provider\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-local\-port=<port>\fR: local port to listen to\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR: show version number\.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
A public key is 256\-bit long, and it has to be specified as a hexadecimal string, with optional columns\.
