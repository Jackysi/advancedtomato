How to compile this.
--------------------
1. Look at start of Makefile and set correct values for:

KERNEL_INCLUDE should point to correct linux kernel include directory.
Default (/usr/src/linux/include) is right as rule.

arpd needs to have the db4 development libraries. For debian
users this is the package with a name like libdb4.x-dev.
DBM_INCLUDE points to the directory with db_185.h which
is the include file used by arpd to get to the old format Berkely
database routines.  Often this is in the db-devel package.

2. make

The makefile will automatically build a file Config which
contains whether or not ATM is available, etc.

3. To make documentation, cd to doc/ directory , then
   look at start of Makefile and set correct values for
   PAGESIZE=a4		, ie: a4 , letter ...	(string)
   PAGESPERPAGE=2	, ie: 1 , 2 ...		(numeric)
   and make there. It assumes, that latex, dvips and psnup
   are in your path.
