read list of interfaces with SIOCGIFCONF (AF_INET6 support in the kernel would
be nice) or from /proc

follow interface state via netlink interface and send RAs only when the
interface is up

use getaddrinfo() instead of inet_pton in scanner.l so that DNS names
can be used

Consider reducing the amount of 'if (MIPv6)' code segments, especially when
checking for allowed minimum values.  Retain the defaults, though.

Quoting Peter Bieringer (peter@bieringer.de):

[ Peter wants that a debugging level greater than 0 doesn't stop radvd
from forking.]

support for few protocol constants defined in RFC 2461 Sec 10 is missing.

consider whether it's worth integrating radvdump print_ff and print_ra
functions as they provide very similar service and there's some code
duplication.

consider whether UnicastOnly flag should be detected by radvdump.

read the man pages one more time and make sure their are understandable
and English is correct

The following parts of RFC2461(bis) are not implemented:
 - section 6.2.1: Adv{Valid,Preferred}Lifetime that decrements in real time,
   that is, one that will result in a Lifetime of zero at the specified time in
   the future. (MUST)
 - section 6.2.5: when AdvSendAdvertisements changes to FALSE, we don't send 
   a final RA with zero Router Lifetime (we just send it when shutting down).
   (SHOULD)
 - section 6.2.8: if the link-local address of the router changes, it should
   multicast a few RAs from the old address with zero router lifetime, and a
   few from the new address. (SHOULD).
