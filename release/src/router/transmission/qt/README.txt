ABOUT TRANSMISSION-QT

   Transmission-qt is a GUI for Transmission loosely based on the GTK+ client.

   This is the only Transmission client that can act as its own self-contained
   session (as the GTK+ and Mac clients do), and can also connect to a remote
   session (as the web client and transmission-remote terminal client do).

   Use Case 1: If you like to run BitTorrent for awhile from your desktop,
   then the Mac, GTK+, and Qt clients are a good match.

   Use Case 2: If you like to leave BitTorrent running nonstop on your
   computer or router, and want to control it from your desktop or
   from a remote site, then transmission-remote and the web and Qt clients
   are a good match.

   To use the Qt client as a remote, in the menu go to Edit > Change Session

   The Qt client is also the most likely to wind up running on Windows,
   though that's not a high priority at the moment...
