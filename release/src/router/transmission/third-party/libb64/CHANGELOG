libb64: Base64 Encoding/Decoding Routines
======================================

## Changelog ##

Version 1.2.1 Release
---------------------
Fixed a long-standing bug in src/cdecode.c where value_in was not correctly
checked against the bounds [0..decoding_size)
Thanks to both Mario Rugiero and Shlok Datye for pointing this out.
Added some simple example code to answer some of the most common misconceptions
people have about the library usage.

Version 1.2 Release
-------------------
Removed the b64dec, b64enc, encoder and decoder programs in favour of
a better example, called base64, which encodes and decodes 
depending on its arguments.

Created a solution for Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Express 2010
edition, which simply builds the base64 example as a console application.

Version 1.1 Release
-------------------
Modified encode.h to (correctly) read from the iostream argument,
instead of std::cin.
Thanks to Peter K. Lee for the heads-up.

No API changes.

Version 1.0 Release
-------------------
The current content is the changeset.
