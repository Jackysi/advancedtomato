libb64: Base64 Encoding/Decoding Routines
======================================

Requirements:
------------
This piece of software has minimal requirements.

I have tested it on the following systems:

- a Linux machine, with the following specs:
(this was the original development machine)
	* FedoraCore 4
	* kernel v. 2.6.11 (stock FC4 kernel)
	* gcc version 4.0.1 20050727 (Red Hat 4.0.1-5)
	* glibc-2.3.5-10
	* make v. 3.80
	* some arb version of makedepend

- Windows XP machine
	* MSYS 1.0
	* MinGW 5.1.4
	* gcc version 3.4.5 (mingw-vista special r3)

- Windows XP machine (same as above)
	* Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, Version 10.0.30319.1 RTMRel
	
Barring any serious screwups on my part, this code should compile and run sweetly
under Cygwin and other systems too. If you DO get it running under some weird arch/os setup,
send me a mail, please.

Compiling:
---------
There is no configure. It would be overkill for something so simple...
Run make in the root directory.

Installing:
----------
Since the current targets are a standalone executable and a static library
(fancy name for archive) with some headers, an install script has not been implemented yet.
Simply copy the executable into your path, and use it.

peace out
