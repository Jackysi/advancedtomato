README for USB_ModeSwitch Data

Almost all new and corrected device configurations since around 2012
were collected and compiled by Lars Melin. Thank you!

Without a well-maintained base of configuration info, usb_modeswitch
would just be a useless blob of code. So:

PLEASE REPORT NEW DEVICES !

This is a data package to complement the full release package of
USB_ModeSwitch, a tool to switch multi-mode USB devices.
It is used since usb-modeswitch version 1.0.3.

Recommended version of usb-modeswitch package is 1.2.5 and above. From
this version on, the rules file does not check for the class of inter-
face 0 anymore, the check was moved to the dispatcher.
The changes were necessary for future MBIM device support.

Just do "make install". To re-generate udev rules file, type "make clean"
and install again ("tcl" package required).


Tasks initiated by the rules file:
==================================

- call wrapper to initiate switching for known devices when plugged in
  (starting from version 1.1.4 at boot time too)

- adding symlink "gsmmodem" to appropriate connection port (out of 2-5
  ports provided by some devices); this is only a convenience feature and
  NOT needed for switching or later port operation.
  This action will be triggered for known modems only (at least switched
  once on this system)

- loading and binding the "option" driver if the device arrives in modem
  state (not CDC/ACM) and the device ID is not yet known to the driver.
  This action will be triggered only for modems known to the system (at
  least switched once).
  To prevent the default driver binding, add NoDriverLoading=1 to the
  respective device configuration file


Explanation about config file names:
====================================

Names consist of <VendorID>:<ProductID>, respective to the default device
mode.
Should more detailed identification become necessary, one or more attributes
to test can be attached after further colons:
<VendorID>:<ProductID>:<Attribute>=<String>[:<Attribute>=<String> ...]

The strings match if they are part of the attribute content. Use "_"
to match spaces (it will match "_" too!).

Currently recognized attibutes are:

uMa = USB, iManufacturer
uPr = USB, iProduct
uSe = USB, iSerial
sVe = SCSI, Vendor
sMo = SCSI, Model
sRe = SCSI, Revision

This list is easily extendable if necessary.

Example:
<vid>:<pid>:uPr=CDMA_Mo will match iProduct "CDMA Modem" or "MyCDMA_Mordor"


Generic config files (per vendor ID):
=====================================

Introduced in program package 2.2.0, this feature allows config files with a
name in the form <idVendor>:#<system flavour>. The default flavour is "linux".

The system parameter is taken from "/proc/version". The main use currently is
a sort of OS switch to treat all Huawei devices differently on Android.
There is no guarantee though that the /proc/version information will always
point to Android, so this method may change in future versions.

Annother form of usage is a fallback if the device ID is yet unknown. For
Huawei devices, the switching method is uniform and not likely to change,
so it is possible to provide a generic configuration.

Example files: see "12d1:#android" and "12d1:#linux"


Parameters used only in config files:
=====================================

These are not evaluated by the binary but by the wrapper.

WaitBefore=<seconds>		delay the switching process

DriverModule=<module name>	load a specific driver module after switch

DriverIDPath=<path to attribute>
				if the driver has the ability to add new device IDs
				on-the-fly, this is the file node to use.
				Example: "/sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/option1/new_id"

See also complete parameter explanation in REFERENCE.


Notes about specific devices:
=============================

- Huawei devices have a generic entry in the rules file; also there are
  generic config files for these devices (Linux/Android) as fall-back or
  as OS-specific mode control. This was suggested and approved by the
  manufacturer

- 1266:1000 (Royaltek Q110): switching method very likely but unconfirmed

- Some WiMAX and LTE devices are included since 20101222; for some of these
  drivers are work in progress or not available yet. Efforts are underway.
  Stand by or search for "staging drivers".

- 05c6:2000 (unnamed HSDPA modem from "dealextreme"): unusually long switching
  time reported, even with MS Windoze - 30 to 40 seconds. Don't be alarmed.

- 0471:1210 (Philips chipset): had to be split after variants with different
  targets and behaviour appeared. This is not fully confirmed yet, please
  report problems.
