    <li> <b>25 January 2003, dev system updates, arm image released</b>
    <br>

    A number of additional problems have been fixed and the arm build 
    is now, finally, compiling and working as expected.  As such, 
    I have updated the <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs-i386.bz2">
    i386 development system image</a>, the 
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs-powerpc.bz2">
    powerpc development system image</a>, and I am also releasing
    upon an unsuspecting world the brand new
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs-arm.bz2">
    arm development system image</a>!  
    Have fun!
    <p>

    All three development system images were compiled and built using the stock
    <a href="/cgi-bin/cvsweb/buildroot/">buildroot</a> system.  These were also
    built using the (about to be announced in a couple on minutes) uClibc
    0.9.17 release, so if you want to begin compiling and testing stuff with
    uClibc, but you don't feel like spending the _hours_ it takes to download,
    configure, and build your own uClibc based development system -- then you
    may want to download these and give them a try.  They each contain a 100 MB
    ext2 filesystem with everything you need to begin compiling your own
    applications.  I have (at least minimally) tested each of them and verified
    that the included gcc and g++ compilers produce working uClibc linked
    executables.

    <p>
    Oh, and I have also have updated the uClibc/gcc toolchain builders, so
    if you just want a simple uClibc/gcc toolchain, 
    <a href="/cgi-bin/cvsweb/toolchain/">one of these should work for you.</a>
    <p>


    <p>
    <li> <b>10 January 2003, dev system updates, powerpc image released</b>
    <br>

    A few problems showed up in yesterday's development system release
    (adduser was broken, gdb didn't work, libstdc++ shared libs were missing,
    etc).  So I've updated the <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs-i386.bz2">
    i386 development system image</a> to fix these problems.
    Also, the <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs-powerpc.bz2">
    powerpc development system image</a> has finally finished compiling
    and is now released upon an unsuspecting world.  Have fun!
    <p>


    <p>
    <li> <b>9 January 2003, uClibc development system released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting (i.e. Erik) has been working hard on <a
    href="/cgi-bin/cvsweb/buildroot/">buildroot</a> recently, and is pleased to
    offer a full stand-alone uClibc-only development system.  This is an ext2
    filesystem for i386 containing all the development software you need to
    build your own uClibc applications.  With bash, awk, make, gcc, g++,
    autoconf, automake, ncurses, zlib, openssl, openssh, gdb, strace, valgrind,
    busybox, GNU coreutils, and more, this should have pretty much everything
    you need to get started building your own applications linked against
    uClibc.  By using a uClibc only system, you can avoid all the painful
    cross-configuration problems that have made using uClibc somewhat painful
    in the past.  A powerpc and an arm version are in progress.  Expect them
    to be released shortly....

    <p>

    The <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs-i386.bz2">
    uClibc development system is an 18MB bzip2 compressed ext2 filesystem</a>,
    so be prepared to wait if you are on a slow link.  If you wish to have more
    space, you can loop mount it and 'cp -a' the contents to their own
    partition, or do what I did... <EM>WARNING, the following can be very
    dangerous.  Please be sure you know what you are doing before trying this.
    I am not responsible if you lose all your important data.</EM>I had a spare
    hard drive (in my case /dev/hdg but you'll want to adapt this to your own 
    needs), so I partitioned it with a single ext2 partition filling the drive 
    (in my case /dev/hdg1).  Then I ran:<PRE>
    bzcat root_fs-i386.bz2 | dd of=/dev/hdg1
    e2fsck -f /dev/hdg1
    resize2fs -p /dev/hdg1</PRE>

    which overwrote everything on /dev/hdg with the new uClibc devel system,
    and then expanded the filesystem with the uClibc devel system till it
    filled the whole drive.
    <p>


    <p>
    <li> <b>8 November 2002, uClibc 0.9.16 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.16.  This release adds full support (including a native shared
    library loader) for the CRIS architecture, contributed by Tobias Anderberg.
    Stefan Allius contributed a number of patches to fix the initialization
    order for shared library global constructors and destructors as well as a
    large number of SuperH fixes and cleanups.  uClibc now compiles with
    newer versions of gcc (i.e. RedHat 8.0).  Thanks to Christian Michon,
    uClibc no longer requires perl to compile.  Steven J. Hill fixed dlopen for
    mips.  Several problems with pty and tty handling were fixed.  Manuel Novoa
    added new support for an /etc/TZ file to globally set the system timezone,
    and fixed up a number of remaining wide char issues.  Manuel is still hard
    at work on bringing full locale support (optional of course) to uClibc.
    And of course, this release includes the usual pile of bug fixes.  Many thanks
    for the large number of patches and fixes that were contributed!
    <p>

    Erik and Manuel have been working on a 
    <a href="downloads/Glibc_vs_uClibc_Differences.txt">
    document describing some of the differences between uClibc and glibc.</a>
    It's not yet 100% complete, and it hasn't been nicely formatted yet.  But
    it contains a lot of helpful information and is worth a look.
    <p>

    And finally, the the old uClibc configuration system has been completely
    removed (and there was much rejoicing).  It was replaced with an entirely
    new system based on <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~zippel/lc/">LinuxKernelConf</a>, 
    which has since been included into Linux 2.5.45, so it looks like Erik made 
    the right choice.  Of course, those who have existing build systems using uClibc 
    will need to make a few changes...  We think the change is worth it.
    <p>

    and <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/uClibc-0.9.16.tar.bz2">source code</a> 
    for this release are available <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/">here</a>.
    You might want to download uClibc from the closest 
    <a href="http://kernel.org/mirrors/">kernel.org mirror site</a>.
    Just pick the closest mirror site, and then go to 
    <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/">
    http://www.XX.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/</a>
    to download uClibc, where XX is your two letter country code.
    <p>
    Updated gcc-3.2 and gcc-2.95 toolchains will be released shortly. 
    <p>


    <p>
    <li> <b>16 September 2002, gcc-3.2 and gcc-2.95 toolchains released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting (i.e. Erik) has released updated gcc-3.2 and gcc-2.95
    uClibc toolchains.  These toolchains build real gcc cross compilers (i.e.
    not just a wrapper) and create executables linked vs uClibc.   The new
    gcc-3.2 provides uClibc support with the latest and greatest compiler
    available from the gcc team.  The gcc-2.95 toolchain has been updated to
    the latest version of uClibc and now provides full C++ support, using the
    <a href="http://www.stlport.org/">STLport</a> standard C++ library.
    <p>

    This toolchain should make it easy for anyone to build uClibc based 
    applications.  
    <a href="/cgi-bin/cvsweb/toolchain/"> Source code can be downloaded here</a>. 
    Be aware that much of the needed source code will actually be downloaded on
    when you compile the toolchains.  To build a toolchain, simply
    grab the source, edit the Makefile to select where you would like
    the toolchain installed, run 'make', and then go watch TV, eat
    dinner, or visit with your friends while it compiles.  It takes
    about 15 minutes for Erik to compile the gcc-3.2 toolchain (w/C++ support)
    on his Athlon XP 1600 (not counting the time it takes to download
    source code).
    <p>



    <p>
    <li> <b>27 August 2002, uClibc 0.9.15 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability 
    of uClibc 0.9.15.  This release fixes a number of problems that turned 
    up since the last release.   The good news is that uClibc now 
    passes all tests in the perl 5.8 and Python 2.2.1 test suites, both with
    and without pthreads.  So without any further ado....
    <p>

    <p>
    <li> <b>12 August 2002, uClibc 0.9.14 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is slightly less pleased then usual to announce the
    immediate availability of uClibc 0.9.14.  This is, unfortunately, a bugfix
    release intended to fix the couple of dumb things that slipped into the
    previous release.  Version 0.9.13 of uClibc would fail to compile when
    enabling both RPC and Pthreads.  There was also a problem with RPC thread
    local storage (but noone noticed since it didn't compile ;-).  Also, the
    thread locking in exit(), onexit() and atexit() was broken, and wasn't
    actually locking anything.   This release also fixes uClibc's gcc wrapper
    to use crtbeginS.o and crtendS.o when compiling PIC code, fixing a subtle
    bug (that was much less subtle on powerpc).  Finally, this release includes a
    few minor compile warning cleanups.

    <li> <b>12 August 2002, Native uClibc/gcc-3.1.1 toolchain released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting (i.e. Erik) has released an updated native
    uClibc/gcc-3.1.1 toolchain.   This toolchain builds a real gcc cross
    compiler (i.e. not just a wrapper) and creates executables linked vs
    uClibc.  This toolchain has been (briefly) tested as working on x86, arm,
    mips, and arm7tdmi (uClinux).  This toolchain provides a number of
    improvements over previous releases.   In particular, Steven J. Hill found
    and fixes a number of "glibc-isms" in the libstdc++ math support which
    caused a number of math functions to be mapped to the non-standard named
    under GNU libc.   This release also includes greatly improved uClinux
    "elf2flt" support, and it now produces working flat binaries for my
    uClinux/arm7tdmi system.  The native uClibc/gcc-2.95 toolchain will be
    updated in a few days, and will include STLport which will allow that
    toolchain to also provide full C++ support.

    <li> <b>9 August 2002, uClibc now mirrored on kernel.org!</b>
    <br>
    uClibc is now available from the kernel.org mirrors!  This should make
    uClibc downloads much faster.  The kernel.org mirrors will have all 
    uClibc release versions (everything but the daily snapshots).
    Here is a list of all the <a href="http://kernel.org/mirrors/">kernel.org mirror sites</a>.

    <li> <b>9 August 2002, uClibc 0.9.13 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.13.  After several days of testing, this release is looking very
    solid.   This release fixes three security vulnerabilites in previous
    releases.  There was an off-by-one buffer overflow in the group handling
    code, and integer overflows in calloc() and xdr_array().  
    <p>

    This release adds native shared library support for the Hitachi
    SuperH architecture, thanks to Stefan Allius and Edie C. Dost.  A 
    new mmap based malloc was implemented by Miles Bader.  This is much 
    smarter than the old "malloc-simple" and is now the default for 
    mmu-less systems, where it should greatly help reduce memory
    fragmentation and wastage.  In addition to these larger items, there
    has been a <em>lot</em> of work done to make uClibc a cleaner, more
    capable, library.  Most applications now compile and run without 
    any trouble.

    <br>
    CodePoet Consulting (i.e. Erik) has released updated native
    uClibc/gcc-3.1 and uClibc/gcc-2.95 toolchains.  These toolchains
    build real gcc cross compilers (i.e. not just a wrapper) and create
    executables linked vs uClibc.  These toolchains have been tested
    and found working on x86, arm, and mmu-less arm.  They should work

    <br>
    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.12. This release adds an i960 port, an initial alpha port,
    fully working mips shared library support, shared library support fixes
    for on powerpc, and many other improvements.  One very exciting new feature
    is nearly complete locale support, thanks to a lot of hard work by Manuel
    Novoa III.  uClibc's locale support is <em>much</em> smaller than glibc's,
    though it is also slightly less flexible.  This release was delayed by a
    month due to the arrival of a new baby at Erik's house.  For those that
    have been anxiously waiting, this release should certainly be worth the
    wait.  Have fun!

    <br>
    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.11. This release is primarily focused on fixing the issues that
    have turned up since the last release.  Several bugs in the gcc wrapper
    have been fixed, allowing applications such as iproute2 and XFree86 to link properly.  
    Large file support has been improved, and a thread locking bug was
    fixed that could cause s*printf calls to deadlock when threading was
    enabled.  Several bugs were also fixed with the powerpc, h8300, m68k,
    sparc, and mips architecture support.  Many additional applications now
    compile and run perfectly and have been added to the <a
    href="uClibc-apps.html">working applications list</a> .

    <p>
    <li> <b>10 April 2002, Native uClibc/gcc-3.0.4 toolchain</b>
    <br>
    CodePoet Consulting has released source code and a Makefile
    to build a gcc-3.0.4 toolchain that natively targets uClibc.
    This brings with it full C++ support for uClibc, including the 
    libstdc++ library.  A gcc-2.95.x toolchain will also be released 
    shortly, but is not yet ready.  At this time, only source code and
    a Makefile for the native uClibc toolchain is being released (i.e.
    no binaries, sorry). 
    <a href="/cgi-bin/cvsweb/toolchain/">Source code can be downloaded here</a>. 
    <p>
    To build the toolchain, simply grab the source, edit the Makefile
    to select where you would like the toolchain installed.  Then

    of uClibc already, it will download the latest daily snapshot.


    <p>
    <li> <b>21 March 2002, uClibc 0.9.10 Released!</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate
    availability of uClibc 0.9.10. This release adds pthreads support
    (including pthreads support for mmu-less systems!).  Additionally,
    thanks to Manuel Novoa III, we now have a completely new stdio
    library, which is small, standards compliant, supports pthreads,
    wide/narrow streams, large files, and can even operate in a
    low-memory unbuffered mode.  Many, many bugs have been fixed and a
    number of additional applications now compile and run perfectly.
    Even with all these changes, uClibc continues to be very small.
    On x86, a default build of the uClibc C library is still just 168k.

    <p>

    To make things more interesting, the release also adds support for
    C++ constructors and destructors.  To make it easy to use uClibc
    when developing C++ applications, this release also provides a 
    wrapper for the GNU C++ compiler.  Of course, for more complex C++
    applications, such as those using iostreams, a standard C++ library
    (libstdc++) is required.  A native GNU toolchain (binutils/gcc) that
    provides libstdc++ linked with uClibc 0.9.10 will be released in the
    next couple of days, so stay tuned.

    <a href="uClibc-apps.html">just about 
    everything we have tested now compiles and runs</a>.  In fact,
    there are now so many programs on the working application list that 
    rather than continue to add to this list, from now on we 
    will only be adding applications to the <em>not working list</em>.  Most applications 
    on the <em>not working list</em> either require pthreads, or require 
    wide-character support.  Work on wide-character support is
    well underway, and will hopefully be moving into CVS in the next week or
    two.  Full pthreads support and rentrancy are on the TODO list
    and are expected to be complete in the next couple of months.

    One final bit on news -- as some of you may have noticed, uclibc.org 
    has been a bit overloaded and somewhat slow recently.  The server should

    During the move, there may be some temporary disruption of service...

    <br>

    After many months of initial development, we are pleased to announce the
    release of uClibc 0.9.8.  This release should be quite solid, and is very
    usable.  This also, hopefully, marks a transition from a slow incubation
    phase to a more methodical release cycle.  From now one, there should be
    approximately one release per month.
    <p>
    The source code for this release is available
	<a href="downloads/">here</a>.


    <p>
    <li> <b>26 November 2001, powerpc shared libraries fully working</b>
    <br>
    Dave Schleef finished off the the work needed for shared library support on
    powerpc.  There had been a few problems remaining, and those are now squashed.
    So shared libs on powerpc should be working fully now.

    <p>
    <li> <b>14 November 2001, m68 compiles again, Large file support working</b>
    <br>
	About a month ago I synced the header files with glibc 2.2.4 for better
	C++ support and better standards compliance.  I forgot to sync up m68k,
	sparc, powerpc, and mipsel.  Dave Schleef fixed powerpc while he was fixing
	up the shared lib loader.  I just fixed up m68k, sparc, and mipsel so they
	should all compile again.
	<p>
	I also finished up fixing large file support (just enable DOLFS in your
	Config file to enable it) and it is working just great, and greatly increases
	the number of glibc applications that will work "out-of-the-tarball" without
	needing any changes.


    <li> <b>12 November 2001, powerpc shared lib support</b>
    <br>
	Thanks to David Schleef, uClibc now has full shared library support 
	on powerpc.  This brings full shared library support to x86, ARM, and 
	now powerpc.  Thanks Dave!


    <p>
    <li> <b>7 November 2001, uClibc application list</b>
    <br>
	uClibc now has a <a href="uClibc-apps.html">list of applications</a> 
	that are known to work.  If you have any applications to add to the
	list, submissions are welcome!


    <p>
    <li> <b>18 October 2001, buildroot uClibc example system</b>
    <br>

	Those wanting an easy way to test out uClibc and give it
	a test drive can download and compile 
	<a href="/cgi-bin/cvsweb/buildroot/">buildroot</a>. 
	This is a nifty buildsystem that will automagically download and build
	a <a href="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/">User-Mode Linux</a>
	kernel, and will then download source for and compile up a fully
	working uClibc based root filesystem.  This should make it easy for
	people to create their own projects.  I hope that this build system
	will allow people to more easily use and build uClibc based systems.
	As an example of how nicely this works, the 
	<a href="http://tuxscreen.net/">Tuxscreen Project</a> is using a
	<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/tuxscreen/buildroot-tux/">slightly adjusted variant of the buildroot system</a> to cross 
	compile the blob bootloader, linux kernel, and a uClibc based jffs2
	root filesystem (busybox, tinylogin, udhcp, lrzsz, pcmcia-cs and 
	microwindows) for ARM.  Pretty cool.



    <p>
    <li> <b>11 October 2001, v850 architecture support</b>
    <br>

	Miles Bader has contributed support for the v850 architecture.


    <p>
    <li> <b>25 Spetember 2001, header files updated</b>
    <br>

	uClibc's header files are now in sync with glibc 2.2.4,
    allowing better standards compliance, better portibility, and 
    better C++ support.
    
    <p>
    <li> <b>4 July 2001, ARM shared library support</b>
    <br>

	uClibc now has full shared library support on ARM.


    <p>
    <li> <b>9 May 2001, libm added</b>
    <br>

	uClibc now has a very complete math library.


    <p>
    <p> <li> <b>9 May 2001, ld.so added</b>
    <br>

	uClibc now has a native ld.so.  It currently is only ported to work on x86,
	but porting to other architectures should not be too difficult.


    <p> <li> <b>15 March 2001, powerpc port added</b>
    <br>

	David Schleef contributed a powerpc port, which is now in CVS.

    <p> <li> <b>19 February 2001, SH port added</b>
    <br>

	Jean-Yves Avenard contributed an SH port.  See his email 
	with the initial patch <a href="/lists/uclibc/2001-February/000409.html">here</a>.

    <p> <li> <b>16 January 2001, uClibc as a shared library</b>
    <br>

	 As if January 16, uClibc can now be used (at least on x86) as a shared
	library.  See the <a href="/lists/uclibc/2001-January/000126.html">email</a>
	announcing this achievement.

    <p> <li> <b>11 January 2001, gcc wrapper added</b>
    <br>

	Manuel Novoa III has created a wrapper for gcc that makes compiling apps vs uClibc
	as simple as just setting "CC" to gcc-uClibc-&lt arch&gt.  This even works when cross
	compiling!  Very cool.

    <p> <li> <b>3 January 2001, uClibc now has a web page</b>
    <br>

	 A lot of work has been going on under the hood with uClibc,
	 so I decided to put together this webpage to let the world know
	 that it exists and is getting to be very usable.
